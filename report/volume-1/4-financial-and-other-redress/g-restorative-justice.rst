g. Restorative Justice
======================

4.320.	
The idea of restorative justice has been in the contemplation of postmasters and
others adversely affected by Horizon since the opening of the Inquiry, when Mr Stein
KC requested that each postmaster should have the opportunity to meet with senior
representatives of the Post Office. [294]_ As of 4 September 2024, there had been 64 meetings
between postmasters and the Post Office. [295]_ The meetings had been attended by Mr
Recaldin and members of the Senior Executive Group. I was not surprised to be told that
the meetings described as both difficult and enlightening. [296]_ Mr Recaldin, in evidence,
described some of the small steps that :abbr:`POL (Post Office Limited)` have taken to address concerns that were
not related to financial redress, for example offering references, presumably in an
employment context, and placing articles in the local press explaining the exoneration
of a postmaster. [297]_

4.321.	In submissions, Mr Stein KC advocated for a funded restorative justice programme which
he envisaged would include:

    a) ongoing psychiatric and counselling support for postmasters and their families;

    b) bursaries to assist with the retraining of postmasters and for the education of their children whose education was disrupted by this scandal;

    c) a tangible memorial scheme to mark what he described as the largest miscarriage of justice in British legal history; **such a scheme should sympathetically record the experiences of postmasters and how profoundly they and their communities were failed by the Post Office and others;**

    d) restitution and restoration of reputation: **in many cases postmasters’ reputations were traduced in their local communities and regionally; postmasters’ reputations must also be restored within their own local communities through engagement with those communities and the local press;**

    e) an entrepreneurial fund; and,

    f) **a fund for affected family members.** [298]_

4.322.	Mr Stein KC further submitted that I should not close the Inquiry until it has received and
considered the proposals of the Post Office and Fujitsu on restorative justice and Core
Participants have had an opportunity to respond to those proposals. Mr Recaldin made
a commitment to provide such a report to the Inquiry, although it is yet to be received. [299]_
Mr William Paul Patterson, a director of Fujitsu Services Limited, who made a total of five
witness statements and gave oral evidence to the Inquiry on two occasions declined to
make a similar commitment. Fujitsu have maintained the position that they will deal with
issues pertaining to monetary contribution to financial redress after the publication of
my Report. [300]_ This position had been explained to Ms Badenoch MP (then the relevant
Secretary of State) who described having early discussions with Fujitsu about the issue
of restorative justice. [301]_ With a degree of reluctance, in my view, the company has agreed
to re-open discussions with representatives of the Department about its engagement
in restorative justice in advance of the publication of my Report. [302]_ I understand that a
meeting has now taken place between representatives of the Department, Mr. Patterson
and Mr Takahito Tokita, the chief executive officer of Fujitsu Limited, following which a
joint statement was issued as follows:

    “Ahead of the completion of Sir Wyn Williams’ Horizon IT Inquiry, the Secretary of State
    and Mr Patterson agreed to progress discussions regarding Fujitsu’s contribution,
    acknowledging many parties are involved.” [303]_

4.323.	To date I have received no indication from Fujitsu or the Department as to how and
when the discussions will be progressed, although to be fair to them both, I have not
explicitly sought that information.

4.324.	In submissions from Mr Tim Moloney KC, he invited me to recommend that work towards
restorative justice programmes should be founded on moral responsibility and that such
work should not be hindered by other legal proceedings. He also invited me to seek a
commitment from the Government and Fujitsu to the effect that they would publish the
final monetary contribution made by Fujitsu to the Department/Government, and/or the
Post Office and any other relevant commitments made by Fujitsu.
