f. Discrete topics relevant to all schemes
==========================================

Insolvency
----------

4.251.	A number of claimants in HSS, OCS and GLOS became insolvent. In many instances, that
was a direct consequence of such claimants being held liable for illusory shortfalls at
their branches. The majority of those claimants were, in due course, declared bankrupt.
Some claimants entered into an IVA.

4.252.	By the time of the hearing I conducted on 8 December 2022, it had become clear that the
fact of bankruptcy or the existence of an IVA was, potentially, a significant complicating
feature in seeking to finalise financial redress under the schemes then existing. In the
Chair’s Statement, I indicated that I would obtain my own legal advice about a range of
issues likely to arise in claims made by persons who had been made bankrupt or who
had entered into IVAs. [234]_

4.253.	On or about 20 March 2023, I received written advice from Ms Catherine Addy KC. [235]_ In
due course, Ms Addy KC’s advice was disclosed to Core Participants and published on
the Inquiry’s website.

4.254.	The primary issue for claimants who had been declared bankrupt or who had entered
into IVAs was how much of any payment made to them under HSS, OCS or GLOS would
be claimed on behalf of their creditors.

4.255.	Ms Addy KC was able to provide me with an authoritative opinion about matters of
principle. As she pointed out however, in relation to some claims in HSS and OCS, there
were relevant factual circumstances to be taken into account in individual cases about
which she had no knowledge.




4.256.	Ms Addy KC’s elucidation of the relevant principles accorded, essentially, with the views
held about those principles by the Department. However, on one issue, there was a
difference of view as between Ms Addy KC and the representatives of the Department
on the one hand, and the Trustee in Bankruptcy of a number of claimants in GLOS on the
other. The issue was whether payments received by claimants who had been declared
bankrupt would form part of their estate in bankruptcy. Ms Addy KC’s view, subject to
qualifications which I need not explain, was that they would not; that was principally
because such payments were being made voluntarily, and because the claimants had no
legal entitlement to the same.

4.257.	In her advice, Ms Addy KC made the practical suggestion that this disputed issue could
be resolved using the vehicle of an application to the Court under Section 303 Insolvency
Act 1986. In the Interim Report, I recommended that such an application should be
made. [236]_

4.258.	
The Minister accepted the recommendation. She brought proceedings against the
Trustees in Bankruptcy of Ms Suzanne Palmer in which she sought Directions pursuant
to Section 303 Insolvency Act 1986. [237]_

4.259.	Ms Palmer had been declared bankrupt (and discharged from bankruptcy) many years
prior to GLOS being established. The Trustees in Bankruptcy had assigned to her the
various causes of action which had permitted her to participate as a claimant in the Group
Litigation. In the proceedings brought under Section 303 of the 1986 Act, her Trustees
in Bankruptcy maintained the position that Ms Palmer’s right to apply for or receive
financial redress under GLOS constituted “property” forming part of her bankruptcy
estate and that they were contractually entitled to recover a proportion of any payment
to her under the terms of the assignment by which relevant causes of action had been
assigned by the Trustees to Ms Palmer.

4.260.	His Honour Judge Cawson KC (sitting as a High Court Judge) did not agree. Following a
detailed analysis of the relevant statutory provisions and case law, the learned Judge
concluded that Ms Palmer’s entitlement to claim and receive compensation under GLOS,
and any compensation she received under that scheme, did not constitute “property”
which vested in the Trustees and, further, that Ms Palmer was under no liability to
account to the Trustees for any part of any sum that she might receive under GLOS by
virtue of the terms of the assignment.







4.261.	From time to time during the course of the Inquiry, I have received correspondence
from claimants who have asserted that their Trustees in Bankruptcy, and/or the
Official Receiver have claimed and, indeed, received sums which constitute a significant
proportion of the financial redress which would have been paid to such claimants had
they not been declared bankrupt. I understand fully the frustration of claimants who,
as they see it, have been and are being deprived of a significant proportion of the sums
which would have been paid to them had they not been made bankrupt. However, as
I have said on numerous occasions in many different contexts, it is simply not open to
me to adjudicate on individual claims or, in effect, to provide advice to claimants as to
how they should act in their individual claims. I am aware that the Post Office in HSS and
the Department in OCS/HCRS and GLOS may pay for claimants to obtain advice about
their insolvency issues which affect them personally. All I can do is encourage affected
claimants to obtain such advice.

4.262.	Finally, a word, in brief, in respect of claimants under HCRS.

4.263.	I have no idea whether there are claimants in this scheme who were, at some stage,
insolvent and who were made bankrupt or concluded an IVA. It would be very surprising,
however, if there were no such claimants, given that the number of claimants in this
scheme will eventually constitute many hundreds. Certainly, the scheme anticipates that
there will be such claimants, since, as I have said, HCRS makes provision for the recovery
of legal fees by those claimants who seek advice about insolvency issues. At first blush,
at least, the principles which have been applied in claims under OCS, should be equally
applicable in claims under this scheme. To date, I have received no indication that the
issue of bankruptcy will be treated any differently in HCRS to OCS. In accordance with
Ms Addy KC’s advice, any cause of action for the tort of malicious prosecution will have
crystallised no earlier than 25 May 2024 (the date of the coming into force in England and
Wales of the 2024 Act). That will have been many years, in all probability, after anyone
eligible under HCRS was declared bankrupt and discharged therefrom.


The Horizon Compensation Advisory Board

4.264.	This narrative is taken, primarily, from the written evidence provided to the Inquiry by
Professor Christopher Hodges OBE. [238]_

4.265.	The Horizon Compensation Advisory Board (“the Advisory Board”) was constituted in late
2022 or early 2023 in order to advise ministers in relation to GLOS. Professor Hodges
was appointed as the Chair of the Board; its other members were The Right Honourable
Lord Arbuthnot, The Right Honourable Lord Beamish (at the date of his appointment,
Kevan Jones MP) and Professor Richard Moorhead (Professor of Law and Professional
Ethics at the University of Exeter). By the spring of 2023, the remit of the Board was
extended in that it was asked to provide advice to Ministers in relation to all the redress
schemes then existing.







4.266.	In his witness statement, Professor Hodges identified four parts of the Board’s Terms of
Reference. They are:

    “1.	The Board’s aim is to help DBT to ensure fair and prompt compensation to Postmasters
    affected by the Horizon scandal and related issues.

    2.	It will advise DBT Ministers on how best to manage the delivery of the GLO Compensation
    Scheme announced in December 2022, with the aim of ensuring that it:

        •		 provides fair compensation to GLO Postmasters

        •		 does so promptly – and certainly before the deadline of August 2024; and

        •		does so consistently with the expectations of Parliament that public money is spent in line with the Accounting Officer’s Duties.

    3. 	It will advise DBT Ministers in respect of DBT’s oversight of other strands of Horizon-
    related compensation by the Post Office, including the Historical Shortfall Scheme,
    arrangements for compensation in respect of overturned historic convictions and
    compensation for Postmaster detriment.

    4. The Board will not consider individual cases for compensation.” [239]_

4.267.	As its name suggests, the function of the Advisory Board is to advise. It has no executive,
administrative, managerial, governance, policymaking or implementation roles. It does
not exercise “oversight”. [240]_

4.268.	In the early months of its existence, the Advisory Board considered whether it should
recommend “architectural changes” to Ministers with a view to combating delays in the
delivery of the schemes. It considered three options: (a) removing the Post Office from
the governance, administration and delivery of the schemes in which it was involved in
those capacities; (b) replacing all schemes with a single new scheme; and (c) changing
the existing schemes from an “adversarial” model to an “inquisitorial” model. [241]_

4.269.	To quote Professor Hodges:

    “Highly attractive as one or all of these options may have been, we concluded that
    such major changes were not feasible in view of the circumstances of the history of this
    scandal and the established status of the HSS and OC schemes, plus the established
    reliance of many victims on their lawyers. A significant number of claimants under the
    HSS scheme had already reached resolution. Any major structural changes would upset
    the expectations of claimants who are currently in the system, raise concern for the
    significant number who had already concluded settlements, all leading to destabilisation
    and issues of trust…” [242]_







4.270.	Notwithstanding its rejection of the options described above, the Advisory Board has
constantly sought to suggest constructive reforms. Over its lifetime the Advisory Board
has advised that: (a) a reviewer should be appointed for GLOS; (b) an appeal process
should be created in HSS; (c) a reviewer should be appointed for HSS; (d) a leading
former Judge should be appointed to chair the Pecuniary Loss Panel in OCS; and (e) a
culture change should occur within all schemes which would involve a departure from a
strictly legalistic approach to the assessment of financial address to a “more flexible and
compassionate approach”. Such a culture change, in the view of the Advisory Board, would
be wholly in keeping with the stated aim of Ministers that financial redress provided to
claimants should be full and fair. [243]_

4.271.	In the Interim Report, I made the following recommendations:

  “Recommendation 1: The Horizon Compensation Advisory Board should not be

  prevented from monitoring individual cases in which compensation has been or is to be
  determined by paragraph 4 of its Terms of Reference. It must be one of the core duties of
  the Board that it monitors whether compensation payments are full and fair.

 		         […]

  Recommendation 3: The Horizon Compensation Advisory Board shall, as part of its
		
  advisory role, consider whether, in its view, full and fair compensation is being paid out
  to applicants under the three schemes, and shall advise the Minister and the Post Office
  accordingly at three monthly intervals.” [244]_

4.272.	The Advisory Board resisted the acceptance and implementation of those parts of my
recommendations which would have involved it in the scrutiny of individual cases. There
was an exchange of correspondence between the Board and me. [245]_

4.273.	In its response to recommendations 1 and 3, which was published on 26 October 2023,
the Department wrote:


    “3. Recommendations accepted in part

    The Advisory Board’s aim is to help the department to ensure fair and prompt
    compensation to postmasters affected by the Horizon scandal and related issues. The
    department agrees that, in delivering this aim, it may be helpful for the Advisory Board to
    be given anonymised information about individual cases.

    However, the department endorses the view expressed by the Board in the report of its
    31 July meeting, and in its letter of 15 August 2023 to the Inquiry, that it would not be
    ‘possible or advisable for us to intervene in the determination or outcomes of individual
    cases, nor to give an opinion on individual outcomes, or an opinion that full and fair
    compensation is being paid out to individuals’.

    4.	The Terms of Reference allow the Advisory Board to advise the Minister whenever
    it sees fit. Reports of its six-weekly meetings are communicated to the Minister and
    published.” [246]_

4.274.	I understand the reasons why the Advisory Board resisted my recommendations and why
the Department accepted my recommendations in part only. However, as I will develop
more fully in my conclusions, one of the consequences has been a complete lack of
appropriate independent scrutiny of offers and settlements in HSS. That is of particular
concern given that many claimants in HSS have never been and are not represented by
lawyers.

4.275.	During the course of the last calendar year, the Advisory Board met on 10 occasions.
It held its first meeting of 2025 on 22 January and most recently, so I believe, it met
on 24 April 2025. I have read and considered the minutes of all those meetings and
without doubt, the Advisory Board continues to keep a careful eye (so far as it can)
on the administration and delivery of financial redress under the schemes with which
the Inquiry is concerned, and it continues to advise the Department on the reform of
processes within all schemes. By way of example, at its meeting on 22 January 2025, the
Advisory Board expressed the firm view that it supported the aim of ensuring HSS claims
were administered separately from the Post Office. That was a view which might be
thought to be at odds with views it expressed previously. (See paragraph 4.269 above).
However, I note that the Board was careful to qualify its support for the change by
suggesting that such an aim should be implemented “as far as possible”. [247]_


Parliamentary Oversight – Select Committees

4.276.	The Business and Trade Committee has issued two recent reports relating to the financial
redress schemes under consideration in the Inquiry.

4.277.	On 5 March 2024 it published a report entitled “Post Office and Horizon redress; Instructions
to Deliver” which followed evidence sessions before the Committee on 16 January and
27 February 2024. [248]_ Its main conclusions and recommendations were: (1) That the
Post Office should be removed from the administration and delivery of HSS and OCS;
(2) HM Government should legislate to create legally binding time limits for delivering
financial redress to postmasters and pay “financial penalties” to postmasters in the event
that time limits are not met; and, (3) HM Government should review and then simplify
the evidential requirements of the claims processes in each scheme, especially as they
related to medical evidence for personal injury, consequential loss and reputational
damage.





4.278.	On 5 November 2024, the Committee received significant further evidence from three
persons who have made claims under three different schemes, their lawyers and Sir
Gary. [249]_ On 19 November 2024, the Committee received evidence from Ministers,
Departmental officials, lawyers who act for the Department and the Post Office, and as
the Scheme facilitator for GLOS and Mr Nigel Railton and Mr Recaldin. [250]_ On 1 January
2025, the Committee published its report which contained 17 recommendations together
with the reasoning underpinning them which are of obvious relevance to the Inquiry. [251]_ I
have read the transcripts of the evidence given to the Committee and I have considered
the report of the Committee with care.

4.279.	The Committee regarded HSS as “the worst of the redress schemes”. [252]_ It was so concerned
about the administration of HSS and the delivery of redress thereunder that it devised
what it described as “a ten-point plan” for the future delivery of redress under the scheme.
It recommended that the Government should implement that plan as soon as possible
which was in the following terms:

“1.     The Post Office should be removed from delivering redress to claimants
through the HSS.

2.      If the Post Office cannot be taken out in a timely way, complex cases should
be transferred to the Department immediately, while the Post Office looks to
automate standard payments for simple cases.

3.      Claimants should be provided up-front legal advice, paid for by the scheme’s
administrators.

4.      There should be an explicit over-riding instruction to lawyers to use best en-
deavours to assess claims and deliver justice that is swift and fair.

5.      The Independent Panel must meet full time until the majority of cases have
been assessed.

6.      An independent adjudicator should be appointed to act as a case manager
throughout the scheme.

7.      Claimants should be given the benefit of the doubt with the evidence provided
in support of a claim.

8.      Offers should be made at the top of the range for each category of loss.

9.      Challenged offers should move into external mediation rather than be reas-
sessed by the Independent Panel.

10.     Binding timeframes for each stage of the process should be imposed, with
financial penalties awarded to the claimant if those deadlines are not met.” [253]_






4.280.	The Committee’s report went on to provide 10 specific recommendations
(Recommendations 1 to 10) which “fleshed out” the plan and the reasons underpinning
it. I do not consider it necessary to quote each of those recommendations word for
word. They are sufficiently summarised by the terms of the plan itself. [254]_

4.281.	In relation to GLOS, the Committee had three concerns which it translated into three
specific recommendations.

4.282.	
The Committee was particularly concerned about delays in the administration and
delivery of the scheme. Specifically, it was concerned about “the slow speed” of tabling
final offers to claimants, i.e. the length of time which occurred between the making of a
first offer and further offers culminating in a final offer. The Committee recommended
(Recommendation 11) that the Department should aim to achieve the goal of completing
GLOS by March 2025, albeit that it recognised that for some cases this would not be
possible. It recommended, too, that binding timeframes should be specified for each
stage of the scheme with financial penalties awarded to individual claimants if timeframes
were not met in that claimant’s case.

4.283.	The Committee’s second concern was that the role of the Independent Reviewer was
“too restrained”. It recommended (Recommendation 12) that Sir Ross Cranston should be
given greater powers to “case manage Group Litigation Order claims throughout the whole
process”. [255]_

4.284.	
Finally, the Committee was concerned that the Department and its lawyers made
unnecessary requests for further information following submission of claims. These
unnecessary requests contributed to a delay in the making of offers to claimants and
also had the effect of offers being made which were “unfair”. The Committee sought to
eliminate requests for further information, save in very specific circumstances when a
case facilitator agreed. It recommended (Recommendation 13):

    “… requests for information should only be made in order to increase the offer value to
    claimants, or in the rare instance where there may be reasonable concern about a claim’s
    basis of calculation. A claim’s named case facilitator should have a defined role in swiftly
    considering whether request for information is reasonable for the above purposes.” [256]_



4.285.	A major concern of the Committee in respect of HCRS was the evidence which suggested
that there were difficulties in identifying and notifying individuals that their convictions
had been quashed. The Committee considered itself hampered by a lack of data
surrounding this issue. Accordingly, it recommended (Recommendation 14) that the
Government should “set out a plan for how it [would] notify postmasters in the scope of the
Act of their right to redress plus timeframes in which these issues would be resolved”. It also
recommended that the Government should update the Committee on a monthly basis
with data in respect of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland as to:

    “(a) 	How many people are under consideration as qualifying for remedies under [the relevant legislation].

    (b)		How many people have been confirmed as qualifying for the reliefs specified by the Acts?

    (c)		     The number of people who have been written to about their right to redress.

    (d)		     How many people that have been paid under [HCRS].

    (e)		The total amount that has been paid to claimants under [HCRS] and the total cost of administering the scheme.” [257]_

4.286.	The Committee made two further recommendations in relation to HCRS. It recommended
(Recommendation 15) that the Department should ensure that redress offered under “a
full assessment settlement” was never valued at below the optional Fixed Sum Offer which
was initially available to a claimant. [258]_ In the words of the Committee, the “fear factor”
should be removed. It also recommended (Recommendation 16) that the Government
should introduce binding timeframes for each stage of the process with financial
penalties awarded to a claimant if the deadlines were not met. [259]_

4.287.	Recommendation 15, the removal of the “fear factor”, was not confined to HCRS. The
Committee recommended that it should be removed in respect of all four schemes
which the Inquiry is considering. That is clear from its wording.

    “The Department should act swiftly to remove the fear factor from the [HCRS], ensuring
    that the redress offered under a full assessment settlement is never valued at below
    the optional fixed-sum redress which was initially available to a claimant. It should
    further communicate this change to current claimants and consider whether undue
    pressure may have formed a part of the decision of some settled claimants to opt out of
    a full assessment. The approach established under this recommendation for fixed-Sum
    settlement offers should be applied as a matter of general principle across all schemes.” [260]_

4.288.	For the avoidance of any doubt, let me spell out what this recommendation would mean
if implemented. The Fixed Sum Offer available in each of the schemes would become
a guaranteed minimum payment for every eligible claimant. Those who opted for a full
assessment of their claims would do so knowing that they would either receive an award
in excess of the fixed sum or the fixed sum.

4.289.	For completeness I should mention Recommendation 17. This was a recommendation
to the effect that the Department should publish “a regular transparency report detailing
external legal costs incurred under all schemes”. [261]_

4.290.	The Department published its response to the Committee’s report on 25 March 2025. [262]_
It accepted in full two of the recommendations made in respect of HSS (points 4 and
6 of the 10 point plan) and accepted aspects of recommendations 1 and 2 (which it
considered together), 5, 8 and 9. Recommendations 3, 7 and 10 were not accepted. None
of the recommendations made in respect of GLOS or HCRS were accepted save that some
of the reasoning underpinning Recommendation 11 was accepted. Recommendation
17 was accepted. It is worth stressing that the Department did not reject, outright, the
recommendation made by the Committee that the Post Office should be removed from
the administration and delivery of HSS. Rather it signalled its intention to “continue to
consider whether it should take responsibility for making first offers” under the scheme. [263]_

4.291.	On 25 March 2025 the Committee took the unusual step of asking the Department “to
re-consider and re-draft its response to [the] report and address [the] recommendations
in full, especially the future of the [HSS] oversight”. At the time of writing, I am not aware
of any further response from the Department. [264]_

4.292.	I do not regard it as any part of my function to adjudicate between the Committee and
the Department. However, in formulating my own views, I have given appropriate weight
to their competing views. Although the report and the response do not form part of the
evidence (strictly so called) adduced before the Inquiry they are sources of information
and informed opinion which cannot be ignored.


Delaying Financial Redress
--------------------------

4.293.	In his witness statement dated 6 September 2024, Mr Henry Staunton, the chair of the
Post Office Board between December 2022 and January 2024, described his early dealings
with the Department and, in particular, the then permanent secretary, Ms Sarah Munby. [265]_
Mr Staunton received a letter from her dated 9 December 2022; they met on 5 January
2023. Mr Staunton maintained in his statement, and repeated in oral evidence, that he
made a note of what had been said at the meeting more or less contemporaneously.







4.294.	Mr Staunton described the contents of his conversation with Ms Munby at paragraphs
19 to 23 of his witness statement. In those paragraphs he also identified the documents
which are acknowledged to be records of the conversation. [266]_ In summary, Mr Staunton
maintained that Ms Munby gave him the clear impression that the Government wanted
the Post Office to “go slow” on delivering redress to postmasters. [267]_

4.295.	Mr Staunton was questioned about the passages in his witness statement and the
documents identified in footnote 265 during the course of his oral evidence on 1
October 2024. [268]_ I do not think it necessary to quote extensively from the transcript
of Mr Julian Blake’s questions and Mr Staunton’s answers. I say that for this reason.
Mr Staunton readily conceded that neither in his own note of the meeting, nor in the
note of the meeting prepared by Ms Munby’s private secretary on 6 January 2023, was
there any express reference to financial redress for postmasters. Further, there was no
reference to remediation (even obliquely) more generally. If, as Mr Staunton would have
me conclude, Ms Munby had even hinted at it being the desire of Government that the
Post Office should “go slow” on compensation, either at that time, or at some future
time in the lead up to a general election, I would have expected that to have been clearly
recorded in the notes of the meeting. His suggestion in his oral evidence that his notes
were never intended to record all that was said was I fear, unconvincing.

4.296.	The conversation between Ms Munby and Mr Staunton took place just a few days before
I published the Chair’s Statement. It was also just a few weeks after the Leading Counsel
for the Post Office and Counsel for the Department had sought to provide reassurances
at the hearing on 8 December 2022, that financial redress in HSS had speeded up
substantially in 2022, that settlements of non-pecuniary losses in OCS had started to
pick up and that settlements could be made to all claimants in GLOS by August 2024. The
stance adopted by the Department, in particular, at the hearing on 8 December 2022 was
wholly at odds with their encouraging Mr Staunton to the view that there should be a “go
slow” on providing redress to postmasters. Such a stance would have been disingenuous
and cynical. That is not a conclusion which I would reach without compelling evidence.

4.297.	Ms Munby has made two witness statements for the Inquiry. [269]_ In the first of those
statements she dealt in detail with her meeting with Mr Staunton on 5 January 2023.
Paragraph 17 of her statement is a denial, in the strongest terms, that she told Mr
Staunton or implied that the Post Office should stall on making redress to postmasters.
In her words “I did not say anything that could sensibly be understood to convey that
implication”.  [270]_







4.298.	No useful purpose would be served by a detailed recital of the points made by Ms Munby
in support of her denial of Mr Staunton’s allegation against her. It suffices that I say
that having considered this discrete issue with care, I cannot accept that Ms Munby said
anything which could, reasonably, have been interpreted as a suggestion by her that the
Post Office should stall or delay the delivery of compensation.


Full and Fair Compensation

4.299.	Paragraph 9 of Mr Creswell’s First Witness Statement reads as follows:

    “The Department recognises that the appalling effects of the scandal on its many innocent
    victims will be long-lasting, and some can never be reversed. Ministers intend:

    (i) …

    (ii) …

    (iii) To provide financial redress to postmasters that is full and fair, whilst recognising that no amount of money will turn back time.” [271]_

This paragraph of Mr Creswell’s witness statement was not a surprise. From the launch
of HSS, the Department and Ministers repeatedly asserted that postmasters and other
eligible claimants in the various schemes should be awarded financial redress which was
“full and fair”.

4.300.	The Horizon Advisory Board, very soon after it came into being, “stated our core belief that
compensation should be “full and fair”” and that “Board members agreed that…..as with the
general law, the goal should be to restore the claimants to the position that they would have
been in if the scandal had not happened.” [272]_

4.301.	In its written submissions to the Inquiry at the conclusion of Phase 7, the Post Office
insisted that the governing principles underpinning awards of financial redress to those
eligible under both HSS and OCS were that such awards should be “full and fair”. In relation
to HSS, the Post Office relied upon the Terms of Reference of the Independent Panel
which contained the overriding objective that the Panel should “assess and recommend
to Post Office a fair outcome for eligible claims”. [273]_ In OCS, the Operations Agreement
between the Post Office and the Department confirmed that the “shared objective of
:abbr:`POL (Post Office Limited)` and DBT [was] to see that affected Postmasters received swift and fair compensation for
credible claims against POL”. [274]_







4.302.	However, the reality is that the words “full and fair” are capable of meaning different
things to different people. That is acknowledged explicitly by Professor Hodges in his
witness statement and I can do no better than quote what he says on this issue:

    “42.	Individuals’ views on what constitutes ‘full and fair’ can differ, since these concepts
    are principles and values that involve individual judgement in concrete situations,
    especially in complex situations. In giving practical reality to individual outcomes
    that are ‘just’ or ‘fair’, a number of considerations apply that may require fine
    judgement in balancing different considerations and different values such as
    delivering speed and closure.

    43.              For example, the following considerations might arise:

    a.	The need to ensure that all elements of loss and damage have been
    identified and compensated. This can be assisted by having checklists of
    types of loss and damage (heads of damage). However, this can result in
    lengthy and legalistic lists that can seem confusing to a non-lawyer.

    b. 	The need to ensure that every type of loss receives full and fair
    compensation.
    This requires consistency in several dimensions – between different claimants
    whose individual circumstances have both similarities and differences, and
    between the Horizon victims and all those who receive compensation awards
    from the courts generally. This leads to two broad categories of loss:

        i. 	Individual sums that have been ‘lost’ and need to be ‘repaid’, such as
        sums paid by SPMs to the Post Office, or other specific sums that can
        usually be quantified fairly readily (pecuniary damages).

        ii.	Elements of loss or damage that present much greater challenges of
        quantification (non-pecuniary damages), such as sums paid for mental
        distress, for loss of income that would have been earned had the original
        wrong not occurred. These situations need:

            1. 	Firstly, precedent in order to achieve consistency (and to be aligned
            with the extensive list of sums, ranges and considerations set out in
            the Judicial College Guidelines (currently 17th Edition) as applied by
            the courts), and

            2.	secondly, evidence from experts, especially medics and psychiatrists
            in relation to the nature – duration and severity of psychological and
            physical damage, and from accountancy professionals in relation to
            the quantification of what a person or business would have earned
            if they had continued to operate without closure or bankruptcy
            (quantifying the counter-factual situation).” [275]_


4.303.	More succinctly, the assessment of what constitutes an award which is, full and fair, may
differ markedly between different decision makers unless strict criteria are laid down
and applied consistently. It would be most unfortunate if the amount of redress payable
to a particular claimant was, to a degree, dependent upon which panel or decision maker
considered the claim.

4.304.	I am also conscious that on occasions, there can sometimes be a conflict between what is
considered to be full redress and what is assessed as ‘fair’. If all decision makers within all
the schemes assess awards to claimants by adhering strictly to the legal principles which
would be applied in the courts, I am convinced that many objective and well-informed
observers would probably conclude that the assessed awards were both “full and fair”. If,
however, such applicable legal principles had the effect of reducing the sums claimed or,
in some instances, extinguishing heads of loss completely, some might suggest that the
legal principles themselves were unfair. In their evidence, both Mr Recaldin and Mr Read
came close to suggesting that some legal principles applied in the courts would be unfair
if applied to claims under the schemes. They certainly considered that the application
of some of the legal principles applied in the courts might lead to awards which were
“ungenerous”. [276]_

4.305.	As I have said already, I have always understood that decision makers under all the
schemes may depart from legal principles applied in the courts in order to achieve
an outcome which is fair. The problem is that there is very limited statistical evidence
available as to whether that ever occurs and, if it does, how frequently. The one strand
of evidence which might suggest that it occurs on occasions comes from the survey
of claimants in HSS. That evidence demonstrated that 8% of those who completed the
survey and who had submitted claims valued in the range £20,000 to £60,000, received
offers which were higher than the sums which they had claimed. It would be very
unusual, at the very least, for a claimant in a court case to be awarded more than the
sum claimed!

4.306.	The issue of whether financial redress awarded to claimants is “full and fair” is most
likely to arise as a cause for concern in claims which have been or will be the subject
of assessment. In OCS, GLOS and HCRS, all claimants have the opportunity to obtain
legal advice, paid for by the Post Office/Department before they make a choice between
assessment and opting for the Fixed Sum Offer. It is very likely that with appropriate
advice the claimants in those schemes are able to make proper judgments about
whether the Fixed Sum Offer is “full and fair” for them, or at the very least, acceptable to
them. However, the opportunity to obtain legal advice which is paid for is not afforded
to claimants who wish to consider the merits of the Fixed Sum Offer in HSS. How is that
fair as between the claimants in HSS and the claimants in each of the other schemes?
How is a claimant in HSS, to make an informed decision about whether the Fixed Sum
Offer constitutes acceptable redress, never mind redress which is “full and fair” when the
claim as calculated would exceed the Fixed Sum Offer by a modest amount? What is the
justification for the Department’s steadfast refusal to countenance funding legal advice
for those who wish to make an informed decision about the merits of the Fixed Sum
Offer in HSS? These are questions to which, in my view, the Department has provided no
answers which convince me that its stated position is justified.







4.307.	I say “the Department” and not “the Department and the Post Office” in the sentence
immediately above quite deliberately. The Post Office explicitly supports the view that
claimants in HSS who are contemplating accepting the Fixed Sum Offer should be
afforded the opportunity of obtaining legal advice on that issue which is paid for by the
Department in advance of making the decision. [277]_ There will no doubt, be many claimants
for whom the choice between assessment and the Fixed Sum Offer will be obvious. It
is most unlikely that they will wish to engage a lawyer just because the Department will
pay. For some claimants however, the choice between assessment and accepting the
Fixed Sum Offer will be very difficult.


Value for Money
---------------

4.308.	Managing Public Money is a Treasury document which sets out the main principles for
dealing with financial resources in the public sector. [278]_ These principles were examined in
evidence to assess what impact they may have had on the delivery of financial redress to
claimants. In particular, I wished to understand whether value for money considerations
played a part in individual assessments of claims or was a general concept which applied
to the schemes looked at in the round.

4.309.	In her evidence Ms Munby provided an overview of the structure and application of these
principles and her role as Permanent Secretary and the Principal Accounting Officer for
the Department. Ms Munby informed me that there were four core concepts which the
Accounting Officer had a requirement to test: regularity, propriety, value for money and
feasibility. Any new and major initiatives needed to be assessed by each of these criteria.
That assessment had taken place as the schemes were being established. [279]_

4.310.	Whether value for money was directly linked to the level of redress offered was said to
be dependent on the ministerial steer as to the objective, policy goal or intent. [280]_ The
intent throughout her tenure as Permanent Secretary was the same: financial redress
was to be “full and fair”. That did not mean, however, that steps would not be taken to
minimise the costs associated with each scheme. By way of example steps were taken to
minimise administration costs and prevent fraudulent claims and technical errors. [281]_ She
was adamant however, that this should not be taken to imply that an individual claim
would be settled at anything less than “full and fair”, which, she repeatedly maintained,
was the ministerial intent throughout. [282]_







4.311.	Ms Munby’s evidence was essentially consistent with the evidence given by Ms Gratton,
Mr Creswell and the current and former Departmental Ministers. [283]_ Each, in their own
way, maintained that value for money considerations did not impact upon individual
assessments of financial redress so as to reduce those assessments below what was “full
and fair”.

4.312.	Not surprisingly, a number of questions were addressed to Ministers and Departmental
witnesses about whether the Fixed Sum Offers represented value for money. All of
those called to give oral evidence supported the view that, in the round, the Fixed Sum
Offers represented value for money even though each acknowledged that individual
claimants were sometimes much better off than would have been the case had their
claims been assessed.

4.313.	The most detailed account of how the concept of value for money was considered in
practice was given by Mr Creswell. [284]_ In particular he referred to the discussions which
occurred within the Department and between the Department and HM Treasury in the
summer of 2023 relating to the proposed Fixed Sum Offer for claimants in GLOS. He
said the Department’s objective was to achieve “timely and successful delivery of full and
fair compensation for GLO claimants”. The Department considered and analysed different
policy options including a proposal for a Fixed Sum Offer for £100,000. The policy went
through a value for money assessment by the Accounting Officer and HMT before a
decision was reached that Fixed Sum Offers would be offered in the sum of £75,000. [285]_
When questioned on this in oral evidence he highlighted the repercussions on other
schemes as a consideration. [286]_

4.314.	
In his closing submissions on behalf of the Department, Mr Chapman vigorously
disputed any suggestion that the concept of “value for money” had ever played a role in
the assessment of payments to individual claimants. He defended the Fixed Sum Offers
introduced in all the financial redress schemes and maintained that they represented
value for money overall, even if in individual cases, some claimants received substantially
more than they would ever have received had their claims been assessed.

4.315.	The written closing submissions of the Post Office were to the same effect. [287]_ They strongly
asserted that the concept of value for money had not been a factor in diminishing or
depressing offers made by the Post Office to claimants either in HSS or OCS. “Value for
money” was a concept relevant only to the administration and delivery of the schemes as
a whole.






4.316.	The Post Office sought to make good that point by reference to the Terms of Reference
of the Horizon Redress Overturned Convictions Board. [288]_ At page 1 of that document,
the following appears:

    “Both redress schemes [HSS and OCS] share two main objectives:

    To see Postmasters whose convictions are overturned be offered full and fair financial redress.

    To design and operate the redress schemes in a manner which represents Value for Money (“VfM”) for the taxpayer.”

4.317.	In its closing submissions on this issue the Post Office made no reference to evidence
given by Mr Alisdair Cameron, its former Chief Financial Officer and Mr Staunton, its
former chair.

4.318.	At paragraph 22 of his second witness statement, Mr Cameron expressed concern about
decisions being made on financial redress which he felt, prioritised the interests of the
Department over the treatment of postmasters. [289]_ He expressed the view that decisions
were being made slowly and, for convicted claimants, less generously than originally
forecasted. [290]_ At paragraph 142 of his first witness statement, Mr Cameron stated that
the Post Office had the financial incentive to pay compensation quickly and generously
because they carried the burden of the costs of administration. His concern was that
the processes to which the Post Office had to adhere to receive that payment from
Government were bureaucratic and complex. [291]_ In his oral evidence he came close to
asserting that value for money considerations did play a part in individual assessments.
Mr Staunton quite explicitly said so. [292]_

4.319.	Finally, I should record that there seemed to be an acceptance in oral evidence that
until late 2023, greater emphasis was placed by Ministers upon the delivery of financial
redress which was “full and fair”, whereas from late 2023 to the present time the
emphasis has been placed upon delivering compensation promptly. In that regard
the Post Office expressly asserted in closing submissions that it welcomed this shift
in emphasis. It maintained that in HSS it had hired more individuals to process more
claims, increased the frequency of escalation meetings, offered face-to-face negotiations
rather than resubmitting disputed claims to a panel, and explored whether the process
of analysing shortfalls should be automated. I have no reason to doubt the accuracy
of those submissions. Following their oral evidence, written statements were received
from Mr. Hollinrake and Mr. Creswell which appeared to row back from that part of their
oral evidence which had suggested the shift in emphasis described in the first sentence
above. [293]_
