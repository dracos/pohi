Volume 1 – 4. Financial and other redress, a. Introduction
==========================================================

4.1.	Until 3 June 2025 there were four schemes in being under which claimants could seek
financial redress as a consequence of being affected by Horizon. [26]_ They were (i) the
Horizon Shortfall Scheme (“HSS”); (ii) a process/scheme under which redress is provided
to those persons whose Horizon-related convictions have been quashed by the courts
known as the Overturned Convictions Scheme (“OCS”); (iii) a scheme to provide additional
financial redress for the claimants in the Group Litigation, known as the Group Litigation
Order Scheme (“GLOS”); and, (iv) a scheme to provide financial redress for those whose
convictions have been quashed under the provisions of the Post Office (Horizon System)
Offences Act 2024 and the Post Office (Horizon System Offences (Scotland)) Act 2024,
known as the Horizon Conviction Redress Scheme (“HCRS”). [27]_ Each of these schemes
came into existence at different times and they are aimed at different groups of people
who have been adversely affected by Horizon and its use by the Post Office.

4.2. As from 3 June 2025 OCS and HCRS have been merged. Accordingly, although much of
this section is concerned with the schemes as they existed prior to 3 June 2025, I have also
considered the merged scheme to the extent that is possible at the time of writing.

4.3. The first scheme to come into existence was HSS (at inception known as the “Historical
Shortfall Scheme” as opposed to the “Horizon Shortfall Scheme”). The roots of this
scheme are to be found in the Settlement Deed which signalled the end of the Group
Litigation. [28]_ The parties to the litigation recognised that there were postmasters and
former postmasters who were not claimants in the litigation but who had been held liable
by the Post Office for losses (usually referred to as shortfalls) in branch accounts which
were illusory, not real. The object of HSS was and always has been, to reimburse such
postmasters for the sums they were forced or volunteered (no doubt very reluctantly) to
pay to the Post Office in respect of such shortfalls and further, to compensate them for
any consequential losses which they had suffered, and/or which they continue to suffer.
This scheme was launched in May 2020.



4.4.	The Settlement Deed also anticipated that those of the claimants who had been convicted
of offences in criminal proceedings in which data from Horizon formed part of the case
of the prosecution might, in due course, have their convictions quashed. Accordingly, it
contained provisions whereby those convicted claimants would have the right to bring
claims for malicious prosecution in the event that their convictions were quashed. [29]_

4.5.	On 11 December 2020, the Crown Court at Southwark quashed the convictions of six
persons who had been prosecuted for and convicted of offences of dishonesty before
Magistrates Courts in England. On 23 April 2021, the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division)
quashed the convictions of 39 persons who had been convicted of offences of dishonesty
as a consequence of prosecutions brought against them by the Post Office in Crown Courts
throughout England and Wales. The convictions of all these people were dependent upon
data produced by Horizon. [30]_ On 22 July 2021, the Minister made an announcement to
Parliament, indicating that the government would fund interim compensation of up to
£100,000 for each postmaster whose Horizon-related convictions were overturned. [31]_ This
announcement was the beginning of the scheme (OCS) by which convicted postmasters
(and other convicted users of Horizon) could obtain financial redress.

4.6.	In all relevant respects (other than to preserve claims for malicious prosecution in defined
circumstances) the settlement of the Group Litigation was expressed to be in full and
final satisfaction of all claims and counterclaims brought by the parties. On the face of it,
therefore, the ending of the Group Litigation brought an end to the claims for financial
redress to which those claimants who had no claim for malicious prosecution were entitled.
However, it soon became apparent that those claimants’ share of the settlement sum
payable by the Post Office under the Deed of Settlement was far less than was necessary
to provide them with appropriate compensatory payments. Indeed, almost immediately
following the settlement, it was recognised that the amounts received by individual
Claimants were but a fraction of the losses which they had sustained. Accordingly, JFSA as
an organisation, Sir Alan Bates and other members of JFSA began a campaign to seek to
persuade Ministers and/or the Post Office that further compensation should be payable
to the claimants in the Group Litigation who had no claims for malicious prosecution. This
campaign gathered pace after the announcement and launch of HSS.

4.7.	The campaign succeeded. On 22 March 2022, the Minister announced that “the Chancellor
will make additional funding available to give those in the GLO Group compensation similar
to that which is available to their non-GLO peers”. [32]_ GLOS was on its way although it was a
further year before the scheme was actually launched and claimants under the scheme
were able to submit claims to those administering it.






4.8.	Following the success of Ms Josephine `Hamilton and others <https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2021/577.html>`_ in the Court of Appeal, a
number of persons who had been convicted of offences of dishonesty in prosecutions
brought against them by the Post Office appealed against their convictions. Most of the
appeals were considered by the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) and a much smaller
number were heard at the Southwark Crown Court on appeal from various Magistrates’
Courts. A very significant number of the appeals were successful. However, the number
of persons bringing appeals before the courts was a small proportion (comparatively) of
the number of persons who had been convicted of offences of dishonesty following the
introduction of Horizon. This state of affairs prompted some to call for the exoneration
by Act of Parliament of all persons who had been convicted of offences of dishonesty in
reliance upon data generated by Horizon. The calls for such exoneration grew ever louder
and more frequent following the showing of the television drama Mr Bates vs The Post
Office. On 24 May 2024, the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 came into
force in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Shortly thereafter, the Post Office (Horizon
System (Scotland)) Offences Act 2024 became the law in Scotland. The effect of this
legislation is that the convictions of hundreds of persons have been quashed. On 30 July
2024, HCRS was launched in order to provide an appropriate process by which persons
whose convictions had been quashed by legislation could obtain financial redress.

4.9.	My Terms of Reference are silent about schemes for delivering financial redress, save for
the obligation imposed upon me to assess whether HSS has been properly delivered. That
is hardly surprising, since when the Terms of Reference were finalised, HSS was the only
scheme in existence. Nonetheless, I have always interpreted my Terms of Reference as
permitting me to assess whether all schemes for providing financial redress to those who
have suffered losses by reason of Horizon are being and have been properly delivered.
No one has objected to that interpretation. Indeed, I have been actively encouraged by
all Core Participants, including the Post Office and the Department, to involve myself in
assessing each of the financial redress schemes which have come into existence and
identified above.

4.10.	I stress however, as I have done from time to time throughout the Inquiry, that it is not
open to me to make my own assessment of the value of individual claims as presented to
the administrators of the four schemes. My task is to make an assessment about whether
the schemes are fit for the purpose for which they were brought into existence and
whether they have been administered and delivered in accordance with commitments
made about them by Ministers, the Department and the Post Office.



The governance of the financial redress schemes
-----------------------------------------------

4.11.	From the time of its launch to the present time, the Post Office has administered and
delivered HSS. It administered and delivered OCS from its launch to 3 June 2025. Throughout
these periods, it has been assisted by Herbert Smith Freehills LLP (“HSF”). [33]_ Prior to the
launch of HSS and OCS, HSF advised upon the nature of each scheme. Following their
launch HSF helped to administer the schemes and advised upon offers to be made in
respect of claims made thereunder. This administrative and advisory role continues. [34]_

4.12.	The Post Office does not fund the payments made to claimants in each scheme; it is
incapable of generating sufficient funds to do so. [35]_ Accordingly, it has been the Department
(authorised and itself funded by His Majesty’s Treasury “HM Treasury”) which has funded
the payments which have been made to claimants. Further, the Department will continue
to do so until every claim in each scheme has been determined. In these circumstances,
it is, perhaps, not surprising that the Department has always had an oversight role in
respect of the administration and delivery of both the schemes.

4.13.	On 3 March 2025 the Minister announced that as from 3 June 2025 OCS will be
administered and delivered by the Department. [36]_ I consider the significance of this
announcement from paragraph 6.191 below.

4.14.	GLOS and HCRS are administered and delivered by the Department. The Department has
appointed Addleshaw Goddard LLP as its legal advisors in relation to both schemes and
the multi-national law firm Dentons UK and Middle East LLP (“Dentons”) as facilitators in
respect of both schemes. [37]_ Payments to claimants under these schemes are made from
funds provided to the Department by HM Treasury. The Post Office plays no role in the
administration and delivery of the schemes. Its only role is to provide information and/or
documents about individual claims if called upon to do so.

4.15.	I do not propose to provide a detailed account of the governance provisions for each of
the four schemes at this point. Rather, I will describe their important governance features
below as and when appropriate.



.. [26]    As a matter of fact, there are seven schemes in being under which postmasters can claim financial redress for losses. However, the four schemes identified in this paragraph and considered in this volume of my Report are those which allow postmasters to claim for losses specifically caused by Horizon and/or the use of data from Horizon. The other three schemes are the Suspension Remuneration Review, the Post Office Process Review and the Stamp Compensation Scheme which are not necessarily related to losses caused by Horizon.
.. [27]    Over time, OCS has morphed into a remediation scheme. The process/scheme has been described variously. I use the word “scheme” throughout this volume of my Report even though, more accurately at given moments in time, the word “process” should be used. In the Interim Report this scheme was known as the Overturned Historic Convictions Scheme but the word Historic is no longer used in connection with the scheme.

.. [33]    I understand that on 1 June 2025 HSF merged with Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP, a law firm based in the United States of America. Notwithstanding this merger, it is convenient to continue to use the acronym HSF in my Report.
.. [34]    I understand that the Post Office appointed Pinsent Mason LLP to replace HSF in 2024, but that they are still providing their services to the Post Office under a “Transitional Contract”. I presume that HSF will cease to have any role in OCS on or before 3 June 2025 – see paragraph 4.13 above.
.. [35]    The operational costs of the scheme are also provided by the Department although the Post Office has contributed to those costs from its own reserves.

.. [37]    As the word suggests facilitators seek to promote settlements of claims made by claimants which are disputed in whole or in part by the Department.
