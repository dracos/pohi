                        POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




                 FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF MARK DAVIES




I, Mark Davies, will say as follows:

 1.    I am providing this witness statement following receipt of a Request for

       Information pursuant to Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules 2006 — Request number 1,

       regarding my role as Director of Communications at Post Office Limited

       ("POL"), dated 23 February 2024.



 2.    I can confirm that I have had the legal assistance of Ashfords LLP in

       responding to this Rule 9 request.



 3.    Before I begin in answering the Inquiry's Rule 9 questions, I want to say that

       in doing so, I am acutely conscious of the pain and anger of those innocent

       people who were wrongly accused and whose convictions have been found to

       be unsafe. No words from someone in my position will provide comfort, but

       my sorrow is sincere, and I extend my apologies to anyone who feels I played

       a part in prolonging their anguish in any way.

4.   Much more is now known about the Horizon system and it is my profound

     wish that I and others had more of the reality before us when making key

     decisions. But we did not, and it is my firmly held view that we acted in good

     faith based on what we knew at the time. I would never have stated Horizon to

     be robust had I not believed it to have been.




 BACKGROUND


5.   I began my working career as a journalist at the Liverpool Daily Post and

     Echo in 1990 where I qualified with a Certificate in Journalism. I worked for

     the company for nine years in a variety of positions before joining the BBC as

     a Broadcast Journalist working on online news in 1999. I subsequently

     worked for CNN as a Duty Editor and then at the BBC again as a Senior

     Broadcast Journalist. In 2004 I joined HM Government as a special adviser

     working for the Leader of the House of Lords, moving to the Foreign and

     Commonwealth Office in 2005 to work for the then Foreign and

     Commonwealth Secretary. I moved with him to the office of the Leader of the

     House of Commons in 2006 and then to the Ministry of Justice in 2007 when

     he became Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice.



6.   In 2010 I joined Rethink Mental Illness as Director of Communications,

     Campaigns, Information and Research.


7.   I joined Post Office Ltd ('POL') in July 2012 as Communications Director

     reporting to the Chief Executive. This role sat on the Executive Committee of

     the business until 2014 when I stepped down from the committee as part of a

                                                                                  WI TN09860100




     restructure, before being reappointed to the Group Executive in 2017 as

     Group Communications and Corporate Affairs Director. The Executive

     Committee was responsible for the day to day running of the business. My

     role was primarily to input on communications, stakeholder and reputational

     issues. The complaints around Horizon were regularly discussed. I believe

     that at all times these issues were handled at this level appropriately and in

     good faith.



8.   After leaving POL in 2019 I have worked in communications for the World

     Wide Web Foundation and am currently Head of Communications and

     Campaigns for the Refugee Council.


9.   I have a BA (Hons) in Psychology and Sociology from University of Lancaster

     (through study at what was then Liverpool Polytechnic and is now Liverpool

     John Moores University).



10. My role at POL covered internal and external communications, stakeholder

     relations and operational communications. It was a complex and demanding

     communications and stakeholder environment through the interplay between

     commercial, political, governmental, franchise and consumer interests. I led

     and managed a team of around 40 communication professionals across

     media and PR, internal communications, design and delivery, social media,

     franchise and Crown office communications, public affairs, policy and

     stakeholder engagement.

                                                                                      WI TN09860100




11. The demands on all functions was intense as POL embarked on a new future

    as an independent business. The range of issues which passed across my

    desk was broad, from a major programme of network transformation to

    regular industrial relations disputes and, of course, the Horizon issues. It is

    important to set out this context to underline the scale of the task facing the

    Executive and Board: in a nutshell it was to turn around an ailing and badly

    neglected business and ready it for the challenges of a rapidly changing

    commercial environment while maintaining its public purpose serving

    communities in every part of the UK. It also had to manage the demands of its

    Shareholder, much of which revolved around ensuring minimal branch

    closures, even where they were economically unviable. This was motivated by

    a political consideration, to ensure the number of branches did not fall below a

    notional level, set in reality by comparison with the work of the previous

    Government. This meant my team dealt with thousands of queries about the

    prospects for individual branches, amid huge political pressure to ensure they

    stayed open.



12. My approach to communications was to encourage the team to act as a check

    on the business, not simply providing information to journalists based on what

    we were told, but interrogating information and challenging it, and decisions,

    when we felt it was in the public and customer interest to do so. We did this

    on countless occasions and I am proud of the work the team did to stand up

    for customers and postmasters, sometimes in really difficult circumstances. I

    am happy of course to provide examples of this work.

                                                                                 WI TN09860100




13. A key priority was to improve communications with postmasters and their

     teams. In doing so we had to tackle a culture in some quarters, which wrongly

     placed postmasters in a subordinate role. This was compounded by the way

     post offices were dispersed across the UK, sometimes with very limited

     access to communications channels.



 14. We put in place a number of initiatives to seek to improve communications

    between POL corporate and the branches, increasing two-way communication

    channels, visibility of senior leaders and improving digital channels of

    communication. Whilst we made some progress, I acknowledge that

    communications with postmasters could have been further improved. We had

    a culture in my team of continuous improvement and constantly seeking to

    build on the initiatives and improvements we had introduced. While much has

    been written and said about my POL colleagues, I wish to pay tribute to those

    with whom I worked in communications, who were professional at all times. I

    have no doubt we could have done more, but I am proud of the steps taken to

    seek to change to a more open culture, a mission which was led by Paula

    Vennells as CEO and supported by the Executive.



15. I became aware of complaints relating to the Horizon system in 2012 shortly

     before I joined POL. As I recall, a colleague where I previously worked

     highlighted the issues from a BBC article and following this I did some general

     basic due diligence on POL's reputation, including what was in the public

     sphere around Horizon and other issues.

                                                                                   WI TN09860100




16. It was clear when I joined POL, that in contrast to previous approaches, it was

     taking and continued to take the Horizon issues very seriously. From a

     technical standpoint, we were being reassured internally and by Fujitsu that

     Horizon was robust and it was my job to communicate this to postmasters,

     stakeholders and the wider public to retain the confidence of consumers and

     postmasters in the system as the allegations posed a very serious

     reputational, commercial and operational risk to POL. Millions of pounds go

     through post office branches every year and I believe that the organisation

     was right to take anything which could damage confidence in what was at that

     time a loss-making business, very seriously.



17. The decision to open up the business to external scrutiny, and subsequently

     to seek to mediate cases, were the actions of a business which took its

     responsibilities to its people very seriously. These initiatives, and others, were

     led with, in my opinion, integrity and care by Ms Vennells and with the support

     of the Board.




18. 1 attended the Board of POL on a regular basis to provide input on a range of

     communications and stakeholder issues. The complaints about Horizon and

     issues with the system were discussed regularly. I do not recall specific dates

     in relation to my involvement with the Board, but I did provide regular updates

     to Board members, including by email, on communication issues.


19. Issues relating to Horizon were addressed regularly at Board and Executive

     level, not least through the establishment of the various committees with


                                     Page 6 of 55
                                                                                         WITNO9860100
                                                                                    WI TN09860100




     which the Inquiry is familiar. My recollection is that issues were always

     flagged appropriately at senior levels, though it is clear in hindsight that the

     Board and Executive and many others in the business, including myself and

     the communications team, were unaware of the range and extent of defects

     within Horizon which emerged in the Group Litigation.


20. 1 did not have any serious concerns regarding the functioning of the Board

     and Executive Committee. I had no specific concerns relating to any

     individuals who served on the Board and the Executive Committee. I believe I

     worked closely and effectively with the vast majority of Executive directors

     and Board members.


21   1 also worked very closely with Shareholder Executive ('ShEx') and UK

     Government Investments ('UKGI') colleagues throughout the period covered

     by my statement. They understandably took a very close interest in

     communications and stakeholder issues. I had regular meetings with

     colleagues from ShEx and UKGI. Relationships were strong and collegiate.

     There was certainly concern from some in POL that their involvement in

     business issues was sometimes too great, and frustration was expressed that

     this could be time-consuming and resource intensive. My view was that ShEx

     and UKGI were understandably keen to ensure they were sighted on key

     issues in order to be able to address ministerial and other concerns,

     particularly given the acute political interest in a range of Post Office issues.

     Meetings with ministers and special advisers were regularly held on a range

     of issues, with ShEx and UKGI always involved.

                                                                                   WI TN09860100




22. I have been asked about an email (POL00302459) in which Mr Tim McInnes

      of ShEx is pushing me for a timeline for the publication of POL's "public

      purpose" statement, which was seen by ministers as a key step towards their

      proposals to mutualise the Post Office business. My concerns related, as I

      recall, around the timing of the announcement and a potential clash with

      matters relating to the Horizon issues. It would not have been in the best

      interests of securing media coverage for the public purpose statement if it was

      released on the same day as coverage about the Horizon issues. This debate

      was part of the `bread and butter' of my role: debating and deciding when and

      how to publish details of new products or initiatives, and considering the

      external communications environment in doing so. Mr McInnes can speak for

      himself but I am sure he would agree that his intent was to seek coverage for

      the public purpose statement, as this was a key concern of ministers. I am

      sure he will also agree that our discussions were at all times courteous and

      collaborative.



23.   Concerns around timings of communication were regular and are part and

      parcel of any corporate communications or government communications

      process.



24. I have been asked about my contacts with the National Federation of

      Subpostmasters ('NFSP') and the trade unions representing employees at the

      Post Office, the Communication Workers Union and Unite.


25. I had varying degrees of involvement with representatives of each, throughout

      my time at the Post Office, although the business had specific teams which

                                     Page 8 of 55
                                                                                     WITNO9860100
                                                                                   WI TN09860100




     had direct accountability for engaging with the NFSP and the trade unions. My

     involvement, and that of the communications team, was primarily to engage

     with communications teams at the NFSP and trade unions on relevant issues,

     and to work with co►leagues across the business on developing statements in

     response to relevant issues for external and internal use. For example, the

     Communication Workers Union ('CWU') regularly held strike action and my

     team would be central in developing media statements and strategies in

     relation to such action.


26. When I joined POL, it had just separated from Royal Mail Group and it was

     clear to me that it was finding its feet as an independent business, still

     developing many of its organisational structures and processes. The business

     was under significant commercial pressure as a loss-making organisation and

     under intense political pressure to keep branches open even where they were

     loss-making but served a critical purpose in communities. Administrative and

     governance processes could have slipped under the radar in this context but

     instead, significant and important work was undertaken at pace to establish

     the organisation as an independent business. The role of company secretary,

     which in my view was performed outstandingly by Alwen Lyons, was crucial to

     this.



27. In my view, the Board and Executive were diligent and effective in dealing

     with the issues relating to Horizon. Faced with an intense and demanding

     range of issues, it ensured that the business focussed on the complaints

     regarding Horizon by: appointing Second Sight; creating appropriate

     governance processes and structures; engaging with complainants and those

                                     Page 9 of 55
                                                                                          WI TN09860100
                                                                                        WI TN09860100




     representing them; reviewing criminal cases; setting up the mediation

     scheme; advertising for more complainants to come forward; and engaging in

     detail with key stakeholders, particularly with ministers and the Shareholder.

     Ministers in particular had regular meetings. Indeed, the business sought

     more meetings than were ever granted, no doubt due to the pressure on

     ministerial diaries. Meetings were held at Secretary of State level as well as

     with Post Office Ministers..


28. These initiatives and steps were aimed at resolving the issues. Whilst there

     was frustration that this was another issue on an already strained corporate

     agenda, there was no desire to overlook it or try to avoid facing the important

     questions it raised. On the contrary, the sincere desire of all with whom I

     worked with was to try to find resolutions. In relation to my role specifically,

     what we could not accept - in the context of what we knew at the time — was

     inaccurate media coverage which damaged customer and postmaster

     confidence in a key delivery system.



29. I have always taken pride as a journalist and communicator in placing the

     truth above other considerations. I have never knowingly misled a journalist,

     no matter what their declared agenda, and have never and would never agree

     to issue information or comments which I knew to be untrue.

      have reviewed the following documents:

 31. I joined POL in July 2012 so did not attend this meeting. As mentioned above,

      I had become aware of complaints around Horizon during my research in

      advance of joining the business.



 32. I have been asked about the reference to me in POL00295386 which is an

      email between Paula Vennells and Alice Perkins. The reference to `NL' in this

      email is Norman Lamb, who was the then Post Office Minister. I imagine the

      reference to me is in relation to his role as a Liberal Democrat MP and my

      previous ro►e with the Labour government of 2004-2010. I think the issue

      being debated is whether he would be unhappy about my appointment.

 34. POL had in 2012 announced the Second Sight ('SS') investigation in

      response to the complaints. The complaints were not new, but the then

      Executive and Board of this period were the first to engage with them and to

      set out an intention to listen to complainants and investigate_ The decision to

      set up an investigation through SS was fundamental to this.



 35. It was of utmost importance to POL leaders to ensure the complaints were

      properly examined. This was based on a concern for those making the

      complaints and the nature of Horizon itself. The system was integral to the

      Post Office network and therefore critically important to the livelihoods of

                                                                                 WI TN09860100




     thousands of postmasters and their staff, and to the millions of customers who

     used the Post Office every day. At the time there were more than 11,000 Post

     Offices and around 60,000 people registered and trained to use Horizon. I

     think I am right in saying around 500,000 people had used the system since

     its introduction. POL served a range of clients including Government, the

     banking sector and others. Any concern that the system did not work properly

     was taken extremely seriously for the very reason that it was so fundamental

     to so many people.



36. I have been asked whether POL prioritised complaints depending on who

     made the complaint. Although all questions and complaints were taken very

     seriously, inevitably, and often unconsciously, you might prioritise

     complainants over others depending on the seniority of the complainant. For

     example, a complaint from a prominent MP might receive greater attention. It

     is a common feature of stakeholder management strategies to consider an

     individual's position and standing when such complaints or indeed any other

     request is received.



37. In relation to SS, concerns were expressed about the quality of their work, as

     reflected in POL00021515. There was a feeling in the business that it was not

     as forensic and detailed as might have been expected. Nevertheless it was

     also regarded as clear from the interim report that they had not found

     evidence of systemic issues with the Horizon computer system. They did,

     however, raise concerns about the wider support and training offered to

     postmasters. I was asked at the Board meeting on 1st July 2013 to prepare


                                    Page 13 of 55

                                                                                  WI TN09860100




     our communications approach for publication of the report: this will have

     included "Q&A" briefing for media queries, press release and stakeholder

     engagement.




38. I have been asked about the role of the organisation Brunswick. Over the

     course of my time at POL we would occasionally use public relations and

     public affairs companies to support our teams on a variety of issues from

     product launches to reputational issues such as this. I recall that we had

     support on this issue at different times from Portland Communications,

     Brunswick and Lexington. Teams from these companies would provide advice

     on media and stakeholder handling. Their role was to provide another pair of

     eyes on issues, to challenge us and to propose approaches to media and

     stakeholder engagement issues. Such input could be extremely valuable in

     terms of providing alternative views or proposals, and in assessing proposed

     internal approaches to media and stakeholder handling.




39. Following the findings of the SS Interim Report, and in an attempt to resolve

     the issues raised in that report, the Executive and Board created the

     Mediation Scheme to address these issues and give those making complaints

     the opportunity to set out their case.



40. I recall that on having read the Interim SS report, and in particular the

     accounts of the way people were treated when accused of misconduct, I felt

     very strongly that the business needed to find ways of addressing these


                                    Page 14 of 55
                                                                                   WI TN09860100
                                                                                 WI TN09860100




     issues and giving people the opportunity to make their case. Ms Vennells

     shared my concerns and I recall that she called me when I was on a train

     going home on the day the report was published. She had also been reading

     the accounts of Postmasters who had been accused of theft and was appalled

     by the way they appeared to have been treated by Royal Mail investigators

     (POL at the time of most prosecutions, having been part of Royal Mail Group).

    I have no doubt at all that her concern was genuine_ I shared her concerns

     and we had a discussion about ways in which to address this. Ms Vennells

     suggested we needed to find a way of creating some kind of "truth and

     reconciliation" process. I agreed and we discussed whether a mediation

     scheme of some kind might be an option. I do not remember who first

     suggested the mediation scheme, but POL00192329 outlines my thinking at

     the time. I had been aware of mediation schemes in previous roles and so set

     out my ideas for consideration by colleagues. Another idea was the creation

     of an independent ombudsman.



41. Mediation seemed to me to be an appropriate and potentially effective way of

     addressing concerns and giving people the opportunity to make their case. In

     the event a number of cases were settled through this process, where training

     and support had been inadequate. This idea was not universally supported

     and of course it did not resolve issues as we had hoped. I am however

     pleased that we took it forward with independent oversight as a genuine

     attempt to resolve issues.

42. In terms of how we publicised the interim SS report, from a communications

     point of view, my primary goal was for the business to be open and

     transparent about the SS report_ While it was interim report, it had not found

     systemic issues with the Horizon computer system, but was scathing about

     POL operations in other ways and had set out details of two bugs which the

     business had flagged to SS as part of the process. While these issues were

     difficult from a presentational point of view, I felt the business had a duty,

     especially as a publicly-owned business, to be open about this and to set out

     its commitment as a newly independent business to improve. To ensure

     complete transparency, we published the report in full on our website and

     issued a press release which was widely covered, not least by the BBC.



43. I have been asked about meetings I attended with Members of Parliament. I

     had dozens of meetings with MPs during my time at the Post Office but in

     terms of specific meetings on these issues, I recall at least three such

     meetings. One was with Paula Vennells, Alice Perkins, the now Lord

     Arbuthnot and, I believe Oliver Letwin MP. Another was a large meeting with a

     number of MPs and parliamentary researchers and finally, I also attended a

     meeting with the then Post Office minister Baroness Neville-Rolfe, Mr Andrew

     Bridgen MP and Mr Kevan Jones MP. My role at these meetings was to

     support the meeting in whatever way was most appropriate, taking part as

     appropriate, keeping notes and other duties.


44. I cannot recall what stage the SS investigation was at, but I think that the first

     two of these meetings were quite held close together and concerned a review

     of where we were with the SS investigation and attempts of the business to try

                                     Page 16 of 55
                                                                                       WI TN09860100
                                                                                     WI TN09860100




     to resolve the issues it was investigating and had uncovered. In respect of the

     latter meeting, I recall that the minister had requested a meeting to try to

     bottom out and resolve these same issues. I remember that this was quite a

     difficult meeting.



45. I have been asked about discussions with colleagues from ShEx and later

     UKGI. I had hundreds of discussions and meetings with them on a very

     regular basis throughout my time at POL and cannot as a result recall specific

     meetings. I took time as part of my role to ensure that communications

     colleagues and others, including ministerial private offices, at the Business

     Department (BIS as it was known at the time), were aware of developments

     and had access to briefings. I also made contact with special advisers to

     ministers to ensure that they too had an open line of communication. The

     primary concern of colleagues from ShEx and UKGI was, as I recall, to ensure

     that POL was taking appropriate actions in relation to this issue. Colleagues

     from ShEx and UKGI had access to all briefings on these issues and prepared

     briefings on a regular basis for ministers. No material was ever to my

     knowledge withheld from them.



46. I have been asked about the role of external law firms such as Bond

     Dickinson. Rather like public affairs agencies, the role of external law firms as

    I understood it was to provide extra expertise, challenge and support.



47. POL's draft statement on the SS report can be seen in the email chain at

     POL00296993. Included in this statement it says "Second Sight have


                                    Page 17 of 55
                                                                                       WI TN09860100
                                                                                  WI TN09860100




     confirmed there are no systemic issues in the computer system based on their

    initial review, but we will continue to work with them, and the JFSA, to

     examine other cases put to us." I have been asked how this statement was

     formulated, including my view as to the accuracy of the statement that SS

     "has concluded there are no systemic issues inherent within the system".



48. In answering this question I would like to set out how media statements were

     generally prepared. A first step, usually by the press office team would be to

     prepare a draft statement based on the report, and prepare draft quotes. This

     would then be circulated to relevant colleagues across the business: in this

     case that would mean colleagues working in Legal, Security, the network and

     IT. Discussions over the business' response to the SS interim report therefore

     involved colleagues from across the business. The statement would then be

     agreed by all involved, issues addressed and if necessary debated, before

     being circulated to relevant Executive committee members for sign off. It may

     also be circulated to the Board.



 49.SS's interim report (POL00002240) set out its preliminary conclusion, that it

    had not found systemic issues with the Horizon system and therefore this was

    what we put in our statement.



50. I have also been asked about POL's role in formulating external responses,

     such as that of the then MP and now Lord James Arbuthnot MP and Alan

     Bates. I recall only that relations with Lord Arbuthnot were such at this stage

     that we shared statements with his office and his office did the same with us.


                                    Page 18 of 55
                                                                                      WI TN09860100
                                                                                    WI TN09860100




      This is common practice. Where a document states "speaking note for JA"

      this means a speaking note prepared for a POL colleague, usually the CEO,

      ahead of a meeting with Lord Arthbuthnot.



 51. I don't recall any discussions with Mr Alan Bates. Again, a briefing note might

      have been prepared for a POL colleague ahead of a meeting with Mr Bates. I

      would have been part of the preparations around any briefing note but I

      cannot recall any specific details or, indeed, if there was one prepared.




LESSONS LEARNED REVIEW (2013)


 52. I can confirm that I have reviewed documents POL00040032 and

      POL00099574. As I recall, the Lessons Learned Review was aimed at

      reviewing the handling of the SS work and report in order to improve ways of

      working and develop processes_ This was standard practice.



 53. 1 believe I was involved in the Lessons Learned Review as a member of the

      Executive committee responsible for a key area of work. I don't recall very

      much else about the review other than such reviews took place regularly as

      part of our governance approach and do not feel that I am able to add

      anything beyond that which is contained in the documents.

 55. I have been asked to set out my recollection of the matters raised in

      POL00192329, including my level of involvement and influence in respect of

      POL's actions that followed the SS interim report.



 56. This document is an email chain between myself and senior Board members

      which discusses media coverage around Horizon issues and SS's 'Part Two'

      Report. This email reflects a key point: we did not have evidence at this stage

      that Horizon was the source of issues flagged by the complainants at the time


                                    Page 20 of 55

    (which was a much smaller number than now). Whatever our concerns over

    the treatment of postmasters in each case, there was no basis upon which to

    issue what I call in this email a "blanket apology", but we did need to take

    steps to underline that we took these issues very seriously and wished to find

    ways of resolving the issue in a way which was fair to all parties.


 57. The culture being developed in the business by Ms Vennells and Alice Perkins

    was around three values - care, commitment and challenge - and there was

    serious intent behind these words. This was a clear case where the newly

    independent business wished to show, authentically, that it was a responsible

    business which took issues raised by people within the business very

    seriously, and in line with its values. Clearly the underlying culture challenge

    was a significant one to overcome, and it is clear that we were not fully

    successful in doing so.



58. 1 have been asked about my involvement in the Weekly Steering Groups (both

    Subpostmaster Improvements and Mediations Steering Group and Sparrow

    Weekly Steering Group), and to explain their purpose, differences, and my

    views as to their effectiveness.


59. The Subpostmaster Improvements group was set up to co-ordinate and

    oversee the work underway to improve our work with branches, including

    communications but covering a range of issues such as the establishment of

    the Branch User Forum. The Mediations Steering Group was to provide a

    forum for senior colleagues to receive updates on progress with the scheme,

    while the Sparrow group, I think, included Board members and was aimed at


                                   Page 21 of 55

     covering all aspects relating to the complaints about Horizon, from legal

     review to the Mediation scheme and more.



60. My role was to provide strategic and practical communications input (such as

     providing an overview of ways we could use internal POL channels to

     encourage postmasters to come forward with complaints or suggestions for

     improvements in procedures and practices: there was a strong ethos (set by

     Ms Vennells) within these meetings around lessons learned and service

     improvement for postmasters. Angela Van Den Bogerd was key to this work

     and an energetic advocate of delivering commitments to continuous

     improvement, such as through the Branch User Forum, improvement

     programme and the Post Office Advisory Council.



61. I have also been asked about my involvement in Initial Complaint Review and

     Mediation Scheme Monthly Steering Group and the Sparrow Sub Committee,

     its purpose and my views as to its effectiveness.



62. My recollection is that it was set up to provide a forum for colleagues involved

     in the scheme to report back on developments, ensure focus on strategy and

     act as a focus point for ensuring the executive and Board were kept informed

     as appropriate. It is worth emphasising that work on this issue was carried out

     in a highly collaborative manner.



63. I have been asked what I understand the reference to "scope creep" to mean

     within POL00138112. There was a concern that SS was seeking to widen the


                                   Page 22 of 55
                                                                                       WI TN09860100

     scope of its work into broader territory than the Horizon computer system. My

     reading of this reference is that it was a suggestion that I needed to be aware

     of concerns in the Working Group about this alleged "scope creep" because of

     the communications and reputational issues it might prompt.



64. I have been asked about my recollections of the principal issues or concerns

     with the Working Group in late 2014 (if any).



65. My recollection is that the principal issue was around scope. There was

     concern that the work was bogged down and that the level of differences of

     view between the business and some postmasters, the Justice For

     Subpostmasters Alliance ('JFSA') and Lord Arbuthnot were risking the

     successful delivery of the approach. There was a concern that while the

     scheme had been enthusiastically endorsed at the outset, it no longer had the

     support of some of the postmasters, MPs and the JFSA_ The business was

     unhappy with the quality of work delivered by SS but was mindful of

     ministerial commitments to keep them involved. There were concerns about

     costs and an expectation gap in relation to compensation between those

     raising cases and the business.



66. I have been asked to consider POL00021525 and to set out my recollection

     as to the decision not to include details of Project Sparrow in the Annual

     Report and my involvement in this matter and my views as to the

     transparency of Project Sparrow more broadly. I vaguely recall a debate

      cannot specifically remember it and so do not feel that I can add anything

      further than what is in the document. However, in terms of my recollection of

      the general approach to transparency of Project Sparrow, although I cannot

      speak for others, my intent was always to be as transparent as possible in

      respect of it. It was a `catch all' for all of the issues around Horizon, as raised

      by the campaign.



SECOND SIGHT (2014)


 67. 1 can confirm that I have reviewed the following documents:



      POL00100200, P0L00100322, POL00116357, P0L00088977,

      POL00105634, P0L00116409, P0L00116426, P0L00116445,

      P0L00101349, P0L00101409, P0L00101390, P0L00211873.

 68. I have been asked to set out my recollection of issues concerning the

      continued involvement of SS. The reality of internal discussions around SS is

      that they focused primarily on the lack of progress the organisation was

      making. I was not aware of any attempt to skew their findings, rather a

      frustration with the quality of their work, the time it was taking and a concern

      about cost. There were also cases where SS did not want to mediate a case

      where Post Office felt it would be of merit to do so.




                                      Page 24 of 55

                                                                                   WI TN09860100




69. The desire was to find ways to expedite their work in a way which achieved

     multiple ends: to give each complainant the opportunity to set out their case

     and have a report conducted independently by SS on their specific case,

     reduce costs to the business and speed up the process. A number of

     complainants had withdrawn from the scheme and were setting out their

     intention to take their cases to the courts and the Criminal Cases Review

     Commission ('CCRC'), and it felt difficult in that context to continue the

     process as intended. There were differences of view over whether to mediate

     cases which had been through the Court system, through concern that

     mediation couldn't do the work of the Court. It should be noted that we

     eventually moved to offer mediation in all non-criminal cases with structured

     discussions offered in criminal cases.



70. I have also been asked what, if any, concerns I had regarding unauthorised

     disclosure (leaking) of SS's report and to detail any conversations with SS in

     this respect. We fully expected the report to be leaked and that was deeply

     regrettable, but I don't recall any conversations with SS about this.



71. Negative reporting of the SS report was frustrating but the business (rightly)

     put the underlying aims - to find a way of resolving and addressing complaints

     - before any presentational issues. My role was to do what I could with my

     team to protect and enhance the reputation of the business. I was being told

     that there was no reason to doubt the robustness of Horizon and therefore

     from my point of view, media coverage which stated that Horizon was not

     robust was not just bad from a reputational view, but was, I believed,

                                                                                   WI TN09860100




      inaccurate. It was my job to seek to stop what I thought was incorrect

      reporting. To be clear, I would never allow anyone to say anything which I

      knew to be untrue. I am sure that had I seen any evidence that Horizon was

      not robust, I would have pressed the business and ensured that POL were

      transparent around any issues. I was always very proud that we as a

      communications team would not take what the business said at face value

      and had I ever been told that there were issues but I was not to disclose them,

     I would not have accepted that.


 72. Coverage around these issues was at the time contained to some relatively

      low profile outlets. Executives and Board members were naturally frustrated to

      see the issue reported in a way which they felt was damaging to the business

      and unfair in terms of balance and impartiality but did not seek to change

      course because of this. The primary concern was the impact on the Post

      Office network and customers.



 73. I was responsible as Communications Director for lines to take and approach

      of the media, albeit in collaboration with others across the business. I would

      make recommendations, take input and seek agreement.



REVIEW OF POL'S PROSECUTION POLICY


 74. I can confirm that I have reviewed the following documents:

75. 1 have been asked about my recollections of the review of the prosecution

     policy, including its background, purpose and my involvement.



76. The question of prosecution policy was raised regularly by stakeholders and

     the Board agreed that it should be reviewed. Although I do not have a legal

     background, I believe the key issues under review were the processes for

     disclosure and expert evidence, because concerns had been raised in relation

     to disclosure of bugs and whether Fujitsu's expert witness could be called in

     any future prosecutions. I believe that I was asked by the CEO or General

     Counsel to be involved to provide advice on communications issues. I would

     have expected to have been involved, as I always was with major issues

     facing the business.


77. 1 believe the approach to the policy was appropriate though I was concerned

     that publicising a change in approach might have unintended consequences,

     and I think this is primarily why we did not proactively advertise the change in

     position. My role as ever was to provide communications and stakeholder

     handling advice. My personal view was that the position of Post Office leading

     prosecutions was unsustainable, but that it was important as guardians of

     public money to have processes in place for those occasions when regrettably

     criminal behaviour was suspected in branches. It was important therefore to

     maintain a position where there would not be a blanket policy of not taking

     forward prosecutions: to do so would mean some criminal behaviour not being

     addressed.

     contained in these documents, however the below outlines the usual process

     that my team would go through when involved in broadcasts / reports.



80. This topic covers a number of media enquiries, of which POL had hundreds

     every week on a range of topics. On each, journalists would ring or email the

     POL press office with questions and requests. These would be flagged

     internally to relevant colleagues and responses would be prepared and

     considered on each question, including whether to offer interviews. I don't

     recall the specifics of these cases beyond the evidence disclosed to me.



81. All of these media matters were flagged to me and I would flag them to the

     Executive and usually the Board. This was to ensure colleagues were sighted

     on the enquiry and its potential impact. This was a standard procedure for

     many (though not all) media enquiries. On this issue I always alerted the

     Executive because it was one of a number of core issues upon which I felt it

     was important to keep colleagues informed.



82. I have been asked what POL's position was in respect of allegations made

     and how this position was formulated. The approach to any media enquiry

     while I was at POL was the same: we sought to engage with journalists

     constructively and to be as transparent as possible. We always sought to

     provide information which was accurate and to meet media deadlines where

     reasonable. This was as true of this issue as any. Media statements and

     responses would be formulated through press officers engaging with relevant

     colleagues across the business as well as Fujitsu when relevant. Intended

                                                                                      WI TN09860100




     responses were always circulated for approval from whichever Press Officer

     was leading on that particular issue.



83. We dealt with each interview request on its merits, taking into account a

     number of factors. Although we started from the basis of always wishing to

     take opportunities to set out the business' position, it was more difficult in

     respect of this issue, primarily because of our commitment of confidentiality to

     those involved in the mediation scheme. As a result, this made it very difficult

     to undertake media interviews. The decision for me to appear on the Today

     programme was for the following reasons: it was a very high profile media

     outlet, and we were conscious of its ability to set the news agenda; and we

     had declined a previous invitation which had frustrated the then Post Office

     minister who felt that our decision had led to her being called to answer an

     Urgent Question in the House of Commons. When the Today programme

     asked us to appear (and as ever such requests are made late in the day) we

     had limited time to consider our approach.



84. I have been asked about the use of the phrase `robust' in respect of the

     Horizon system (in respect of the relevant matters/broadcasts/reports) and

     key conversations regarding this term. I do not recall where the phrase

     "robust" originated. I think it predated my arrival at Post Office. I do remember

     discussing it with colleagues and we sought to be clear in setting out that we

     recognised that Horizon, like all computer systems, was not perfect. This was

     a long-standing position. Given its role processing millions of transactions




                                     Page 30 of 55
                                                                                         WITNO9860100
                                                                                    WI TN09860100




     each day, and more than 60,000 people using it, this felt eminently

     reasonable in the context of what we knew at the time.



85. I have also been asked where the view that the SS review "found no evidence

     at all of any systemic problems with the Horizon system" originated from. As

     noted above, I believe this was based on SS's statement in its interim report

     which states at 8.2 "We have so far found no evidence of system wide

     (systemic) problems with the Horizon software", as well as SS's ongoing work.

     The organisation did not find systemic issues, no doubt because like POL it

     did not at the time have access to all the facts.



86. I have also been asked where the view that people had "faced lifestyle

     difficulties" originated from. This was a phrase I used in a live radio interview

     on the BBC Today programme. I was trying to make the point that POL was

     sorry - genuinely - that people had faced challenges in their lives, but that it

     didn't necessarily follow that POL was responsible. This was a reasonable

     sentiment given what we knew at the time. The word "lifestyle" was obviously

     clumsy and unintended. For the avoidance of any doubt it was not scripted or

     planned. It was certainly not meant to cause offence. It was literally a slip of

     the tongue in a high pressure media interview and I am very sorry for any

     offence caused.



87. I have been asked about the investigations and enquiries I made to reach the

     conclusions as to the reliability of the Horizon system as communicated to the

     relevant broadcaster/publisher/journalist.


                                    Page 31 of 55

                                                                                   WI TN09860100




88. As noted above, POL had at the time a press office team which would lead on

     all press inquiries, reporting to me. They were a high performing and high

     quality team. They would ensure any query on this matter was flagged to me.

     They would lead on dealing with specific questions and interview requests,

     updating me as required. In doing so they would speak in detail to relevant

     colleagues within the business — specifically legal, network, security and IT —

     and Fujitsu as appropriate.


89. They would report back to me and we would discuss statements and

     information to be passed on to the journalist(s). I would also on occasion talk

     to Fujitsu and I spoke regularly on these matters to colleagues such as

     Angela Van Den Bogerd, Rodric Willliams, various GCs and ClOs (General

     Counsel and Chief Information Officers), and network colleagues at all levels

     in the organisation.



90. In order to reach the conclusions as to the reliability of the Horizon system as

     communicated to the relevant broadcaster/publisher/journalist, as with any

     media enquiry, my team and I would interrogate relevant departments in the

     business, and often challenge them around proposed responses to media

     enquiries. As a publicly owned business POL, I believe, has a particular

     responsibility to seek to engage with the media, balancing that with

     commercial and other considerations such as confidentiality. On these issues,

     we worked with colleagues in legal, the network and IT to understand issues

     and prepare media responses, and also with Fujitsu through engagement with

     its media team.

91. As with many issues there were a range of views on how best to handle

     media matters. I always sought to take views as appropriate and relevant from

     a broad range of internal stakeholders. I do not recall any wild variances of

     view and overall there was a healthy spirit of collaboration across the

     organisation and while our public positions were carefully scrutinised I do not

     recall any occasion where a colleague expressed a view that the approach we

     were taking was flawed or inaccurate.


92. I have been asked about the involvement of POL's criminal law team

     (specifically) and wider legal team in formulating media responses. As I have

     set out above, my team and I always sought to involve all relevant teams and

     to consult with them in a collaborative fashion. This included the criminal law

     team and wider legal team. My own dealings were largely with General

     Counsel and Rodric Williams. If we got a media query, the Legal team would

     have the opportunity to comment on what we planned to say and, where

     appropriate, challenge or make suggestions. We took what they said

     extremely seriously as they were so close to the issues. It was a very

     collaborative approach and, importantly, we wanted to make sure that we did

     not say anything that was legally inaccurate.




93. 1 have also been asked about any liaison with Fujitsu. Most of the liaison with

     Fujitsu in relation to media enquiries was between POL press office and the

     Fujitsu press team, though of course there were many other specialist to




                                    Page 33 of 55

                                                                                 WI TN09860100




     specialist contacts. I spoke on occasion to Fujitsu communications colleagues

     in order to share media strategies and to understand the company's position.



94. Overall, POL sought to adopt an accurate and constructive position in respect

     of each of the media engagements referred to above. Given the lack of

     interest from the vast majority of journalists, and the apparent lack of

     impartiality on the part of some of those covering the issue, we believed we

     were acting in good faith and appropriately based on the context of what we

     knew at the time. We never attempted to mislead or hide information.



95. I think the email at POL00351102 reflects the nature of the reputational and

     communications challenge that we were facing in the context of what we

     understood the position to be at the time, having taken numerous steps to

     address the issues being raised. What it shows is that, contrary to allegations

     made by the BBC and others, there was no attempt to restrict any information.

     Our confidence in Horizon was clearly misplaced given what has

     subsequently come to light but we were certainly not discussing ways of trying

     to hide information as has been incorrectly alleged.

 97. I have been asked to set my recollection of POL's response to the

      Westminster Hall Debate, the Parliamentary Select Committee issues with the

      Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme in early to spring 2015 and SS's

      Second Report.

98. Like all colleagues at the time I took these events very seriously. There was a

     degree of parliamentary interest in this issue and it was important to us all to

     provide accurate and timely information to Parliament and its members.


99. I had responsibility for stakeholder relations and public affairs. Political

     interest in POL was and is very significant, with particular focus on branch

     issues. The relevant team in my directorate was responsible for relationships

     with MPs and other elected representatives and for the information we shared

     with them. In terms of the Mediation Scheme and the SS second report, my

     role was to assess the external and internal communications implications of

     developments and to develop handling strategies.


100. In relation to the Westminster Hall, the role of my team was to brief the

     ministerial team as required and guided by SHEx/UKGl and ministerial private

     offices, to provide briefings to MPs (both where requested but also proactively

     to seek to balance the debate), to monitor the debate, report back on its

     contents to the business (Executive and Board) and to follow up on specific

     points raised, as guided by ShexlUKGI and our own initiative.


101. I was the senior manager responsible for communications and stakeholder

     management. Co-ordinating and consulting with other senior managers, and

     sharing information and approaches with the Board was a key part of my role.

     I recall there was broad agreement in relation to the handling strategies we

     had in place for these events.


102. Fujitsu were regularly consulted and questioned by senior managers in all

     relevant departments at Post Office. In terms of my role this would involve

      discussions between the Post Office media team and their opposite numbers

      at Fujitsu. These took place very regularly on all media and stakeholder

      issues.


 103. We always sought to provide accurate and timely information. We took our

      role extremely seriously and this is reflected in the extensive briefing packs

      and responses to Parliamentary debates and engagement with

      parliamentarians. There was absolute determination on the part of all with

      whom I worked, from the Board and CEO, to ensure we provided accurate

      information in good faith.

105. We were contacted by Panorama about its intention to cover the complaints

     around the Horizon system in the normal way, through contact to the press

     office. The team alerted me and I will have made sure that the Executive and

     Board were aware, particularly given the higher profile of the Panorama

     programme than previous media enquiries.



106. My role was to set out strategy in relation to the Panorama programme. This

     was by far the most high profile media outlet to focus on the Horizon issues,

     with the potential to drive more media coverage through other BBC outlets. It

     is a programme with a reputation for taking a strong and campaigning

     approach to issues, meaning that getting a fair hearing for a position is more

     challenging.

                                                                                     WI TN09860100




107. I was therefore anxious to ensure that we considered all possible approaches

     to engagement with Panorama. Having been a journalist, I genuinely wanted

     to help them in producing a balanced and impartial report. This started from a

     desire to help the journalists making the programme in the hope — perhaps

     naively — that we might be able to reflect the Post Office's sincere attempts to

     resolve the issues. In doing so however I was also — as demonstrated in

     evidence disclosed to the Inquiry — eager to be assertive in stating what I felt

     to be the Post Office's right to have adequate time to consider questions, to

     make its points and to understand the motive for making the programme at a

     time when we were seeking to deal with the issues through the Mediation

     Scheme.


108. The confidentiality of the Mediation Scheme was a critical point and we were

     unhappy that the BBC wished to cover the issue when that was underway. It

     was also clear to us that Mr Nick Wallis was working with the Panorama

     journalists. Mr Wallis is a journalist who has covered these issues for many

     years and has been clear in his view that Post Office was in the wrong — that

     is his right, of course, but it naturally influenced the way we engaged with him,

     though we were always — I believe — helpful and courteous.


109. Regardless of all of the above factors, my team and I sought to engage

     constructively and transparently with Panorama journalists at the outset and

     we offered a meeting to answer their questions which went ahead. There was

     never any intent by myself or my colleagues to mislead any journalist.

     However, it is important to flag that at the time of this meeting I genuinely

     believed and had been assured that Horizon was robust.

                                                                                    WI TN09860100




110. We also offered to provide access to the Horizon system so that they could

     see how it worked — this was refused. We also suggested that the programme

     speak to postmasters who had used Horizon without issue, and to the NFSP,

     which represented 6000 postmasters at the time (and was never more than a

     critical friend to POL). Again, these offers were not taken up, which to me,

     further underlined the adversarial approach being taken by Panorama.


111. We were initially keen to ensure a Post Office leader appeared on the

     programme. We debated whether this would be Paula Vennells or Angela Van

     Den Bogerd. Eventually we concluded that due to the focus on individual

     cases, and own commitment to confidentiality, this would not be in the best

     interests of POL, so we issued a statement (POL00152835). This very full

     statement sets out very clearly, in my opinion, the POL position on these

     issues at the time and in the context of what we knew at the time. I do not

     recall how much of the statement was reflected in the Panorama programme

     but I do not believe it was very much.


112. I also persuaded the business to agree to propose to the BBC that we would

     share information confidentially on a lawyer to lawyer basis. This was also

     refused by Panorama. As a former journalist I understand why, but this was a

     further disappointment to us.


113. At this stage I switched strategy. It was clear to me that the programme would

     be very damaging to POL's reputation because it would be extremely difficult

     to ensure balance and impartiality. Working with the team, we then sought to

     raise objections to the programme through editorial and legal avenues. The

                                                                                         WI TN09860100




     aim was to persuade the BBC not to run the programme. My role was to

     reduce reputational risk to POL and it follows therefore that I would take the

     view that if we could avoid the programme being broadcast that would be the

     best outcome. Again, this is with the backdrop that it was not just that I

     thought the Panorama would be damaging, but I genuinely believed it to be

     wrong.


114. All of the above actions were taken collaboratively as I worked closely with my

     team, the Executive, the legal, network and IT teams.



115. As the senior manager responsible for communications I ensured that the

     wider Executive and the Board were kept informed on developments and our

     strategy in relation to the Panorama programme.




116. We also had a lot of dealings with Fujitsu over Panorama's questions,

     specifically in relation to remote access. It is hugely frustrating to me that it

     now appears the information we were given was not accurate.



117. Every question relayed to us by the media was taken very seriously. Each and

     every one was investigated internally by the relevant departments and put to

     Fujitsu. While of course it is natural with hindsight to question myself as to

     whether I pushed enough internally, it is self-evident that me and my team

     could only rely on what we were told, and told in good faith. All criminal cases

     had been reviewed by external legal teams, and every case raised with us

     had been investigated by relevant Post Office teams.

118. I have been asked about POL00117439. It was a fundamental element of our

     internal communications approach that we sought to keep colleagues updated

     on all major developments impacting the business. We therefore made

     strenuous efforts on this and other major issues to keep colleagues informed.

     The teleconferences were part of this approach: these were conference calls

     where we updated senior leaders on the latest developments on an issue, in

     this case Horizon but others would have included industrial action, new

     partnerships and business performance updates.



119. I don't recall who asked for a "short script" as referred to in respect of

     POL00117439, but such requests were not unusual. Colleagues, and

     particularly those working in customer or client facing roles, would like to have

     a few speaking points to hand in case of questions about an issue seen in the

     media or elsewhere.



120. The Blast films reference (POL00021535) refers to a "fly on the wall"

     documentary called Signed, Sealed, Delivered, which was broadcast on the

     BBC_ I do not recall the nature of the inaccuracies I was seeking to address

     but I do recall that following conversations with the documentary makers,

     changes were made and that while the programme - for which I was an

     enthusiastic advocate - was at times challenging for the business it was also a

     powerful and compelling piece of television about a business going through

     significant and sweeping change. The programme makers had wide, though

     not unrestricted, access to the business.

121. I have been asked about POL00117417 and any conversations or

     communications that I had regarding its contents either with Rodric Williams

     or with any other person. I believe Rodric Williams was simply alerting me to

     the potential for emails such as this one to be subject to disclosure in the

     future. I took this as good governance on his part. I cannot recall any other

     conversations with him or others on this issue but it is worth noting that I

     spoke to Rodric Williams very regularly and worked very closely with him.



122. I have been asked about POL00317411, POL00168269, POL00230093 and

     POL00317613 and whether this type of divergence in views was typical. I

     don't really see these examples as particularly unusual. They appear to be

     colleagues expressing frustration with their boss (me) and that's hardly

     surprising. We had many debates and open communication in a pressured

     environment. It is very normal in such circumstances to occasionally disagree,

     but all such divergences of view were always resolved in a perfectly amicable

     way, as far as I recall.


123. As with any high profile media-handling issue there are sometimes differences

     of view over strategy and tactics and I have no doubt that my approach will

     have not always been supported by some colleagues, and that colleagues

     within my own team might have raised questions about my approach. This is

     entirely unsurprising to me. What I do know is that I welcomed challenge and

     listened to all views, and usually took them on board. I do not believe there

     were any major disagreements in terms of handling this issue.

124. 1 have been asked about P0L00162568, POL00231025, POL00231031 and

     POL00174408 and why I understood Fujitsu were issuing "a short line on the

     programme".



125. Our media team liaised with Fujitsu regularly and it was from those

     discussions we would have learned of the organisation's plan to issue a "short

     line" as a statement to the programme on its allegations. I sometimes felt

     Fujitsu did not fully appreciate the seriousness of the allegations and I think I

     felt Mr Carter's email was a little complacent.



126. I remember Elena's email (POL00174414) and I know that we discussed it at

     a later point. I don't recall the conversation in detail. I discussed these issues

     and media coverage with many internal colleagues.




127. I have been asked about POL00174423 and POL00162628 and what I

     understood the NFSP's position to be on the matters raised in the broadcast

     and my view of the same. The NFSP's leadership at the time of the

     programme were of the view that Horizon worked well and was robust. The

     NFSP represented around 6,000 postmasters and while the leadership was

     sometimes criticised (as all in such positions can be) their views were

     important and relevant. It was a matter of regret and bemusement that

     Panorama did not feel the NFSP had any relevance in these matters and did

     not interview them, or indeed any other dissenting voice, of which there were

     many, on the programme.

THE COMPLAINT REVIEW AND MEDIATION SCHEME



 128. I have been asked to set out my views as to the status of mediation as at the

      summer/autumn of 2015 up until I ceased to be involved.



 129. By this time the Mediation Scheme was in trouble. The Post Office was being

      accused of bad faith, which did not seem reasonable, and a number of

      complainants were refusing to take part. I think there was also speculation

      about plans to take cases down legal routes (which was always my hope

      given how little Post Office could do off its own bat in relation to criminal

      cases) including the CCRC. We were concerned about costs and the lack of

      agreement over which cases to mediate. In some cases POL was

      recommending mediation in cases where SS was not. There were also

      concerns about SS's independence. A clean break approach seemed to have

      merits. I supported the idea of moving all cases to mediation, with structured

      discussions for criminal cases, and the continuing involvement of SS in

      producing reports on individual cases.

131. 1 have been asked to set out my involvement with matters relating to the

     campaign by the Justice for Sub Postmasters Alliance and the Group

     Litigation and the Postmaster Litigation Steering Group.



132. My role was to provide advice on handling communications and stakeholder

     issues, including internally, and the delivery of agreed approaches to media

     enquiries and, to some extent, stakeholder engagement. I felt that the

     Steering Group was an effective forum for ensuring collaborative working

     across the business.



133. I have been asked about the handling of and reaction to the Common Issues

     Judgment ('CIJ') - including in respect of recusal, appeal and decision-making

     from a communications and stakeholder perspective. A key issue for the

     business in relation to the CIJ was to provide reassurance and information to

     the branch network, and customers, in relation to the judgement. As with any

     major announcement or development, the role of communications was to

     ensure a structured and detailed strategy was in place. Such approaches

     were discussed and debated in detail among senior leaders from across the

     business. On recusal I was asked to provide a verbal brief on likely media and

     stakeholder reaction to the recusal request.



134. I have also been asked about the handling of and reaction to the Horizon

     Issues Judgment from a communications and stakeholder perspective. My

     departure from the business had been announced by this point and I was

     effectively on gardening leave. I made myself available to provide support and

     advice, but was not called upon to a significant degree. A significant amount

     of work had been done to prepare for the judgement.



135. I have also been asked about the handling of and reaction to the issue of

     remote access. I was intensely frustrated that the positions we took on remote

     access changed as new information came to light. No communicator wants to

     be in the position of having issued a position finding it to be flawed. But I am

                                                                                      WI TN09860100
                                                                                  WI TN09860100




     as certain as I can be that when this happened we did the right thing in

     ensuring discrepancies in earlier positions were put right. We could only say

     what we believed to be the case at the time, on an issue which was complex

     and not necessarily relevant to specific cases.



136. I have also been asked about the handling of and reaction to the disclosure of

     the Known Error Log. In doing so I have referred to POL00112591 and

     POL00112596, emails from Mr Ben Foat. This underlines that the extent of

     the Known Error Log was not revealed to POL until 2019, a matter of deep

     frustration to me because it means that I made misleading statements without

     access to all the facts. I believe the emails from Mr Foat and Mr Alistair

     Cameron accurately reflect both the substance of the disclosure and the

     emotion that many in the business felt when this information emerged.



137. I have been asked for my view as to the role lawyers involved in the Group

     Litigation had in respect of matters that involved communications, including

     identifying any relevant individuals. As I explained above, I considered legal

     involvement to be key. In my experience, I found the legal teams and

     colleagues I worked with to have the highest standards of probity. The

     lawyers I interacted with provided advice and guidance where it was relevant

     to communications issues. I have no recollection of lawyers trying to "instruct"

     communicators on content then dispersed to media or internally.



138. Conversely, I have been asked whether those involved in communications

     were involved in providing instructions in respect of the conduct of the Group


                                    Page 48 of 55

                                                                                  WI TN09860100




     Litigation and for my views as to whether this was appropriate. I do not recall

     myself or anyone in communications providing instructions in respect of the

     conduct of the Group Litigation and I think it would have been inappropriate to

     do so. Communications is a critical element of any organisation but should act

     in service of the organisation, not as a decision maker on areas outside the

     communications profession. I think I was asked to review statements in

     relation to tone but nothing more.



139. I have been asked to set out the reasons for my departure from the business.

    I left the business in 2019 shortly after the arrival of a new CEO. I did not have

     a conversation with him about my leaving though I have read the email

     (POL00103663) which seems to suggest that he was unhappy that we did not

     secure more media coverage for announcements around the banking

     framework with the High Street banks and a new agreement with the Bank of

     Ireland. He did not discuss either of these issues with me directly. My

     recollection is that he and I only had two conversations of any length. In the

     second of these I told him about a personal issue, my diagnosis with blood

     cancer, which occasionally led to me attending hospital appointments. Shortly

     after this the then People and Engagement director set out the business'

     desire for me to leave. My role in the matters before this Inquiry were never

     mentioned beyond a request for me to provide support on the issue on a

     consultancy basis. I was not in fact called upon to do so to any great degree.

     have the message which was sent by the then CEO to the business about my

     departure and would be happy of course to share it with the inquiry.

CONCLUSIONS

 140. Thank you for the opportunity to make some general remarks.



 141. I want to stress my belief that all of those with whom I worked most closely at

      POL addressed these matters in good faith. I know I did. There was no

      predetermined agenda and there was a desire to resolve these issues

      appropriately, no matter how uncomfortable that might be for the Post Office

      and its leadership. That we were not able to do so through the Second Sight

      investigation and the Mediation Scheme is a matter of profound regret.



 142. Context is critical, if unpalatable, and I believe any group of executives and

      Board members would make the same decisions as those made during my

      time at POL in the context of the information and evidence available at the

      time.



 143. As I have said, it is a source of huge personal frustration to me that

      misleading public statements were unintentionally made due to an apparent

      lack of transparency on the part of Fujitsu. In his judgement (Alan Bates and

      Others v Post Office Limited [2019] EWHC 3408 (QB)), Lord Justice Fraser

      (para 934) states "...Fujitsu sought to keep from the court, and may not even

      have fully disclosed to the Post Office. Because the extent of these powers

      was kept secret in this way, the Post Office finds itself now having made

      misleading public statements previously." For me, this is the crux of the issue

      and appears to be the major failing: a lack of information flowing from parts of




                                     Page 50 of 55
                                                                                       WITNO9860100
                                                                                    WI TN09860100




     POL and/or Fujitsu to the Executive, and in some cases misleading

     information.


144. It is clear that had we known more about Horizon much earlier, than these

     matters could have been resolved much earlier. I for one would have sought

     to ensure that appropriate actions were taken but I do believe that I did my

     best in good faith based on the information I had to hand.



145. My belief is that the same could be said for Ms Vennells. The leader I knew

     was one who has deep integrity and who was guided by deeply held personal

     values. She seemed to me to place these values at the forefront of her

     consideration of these issues. She was sincere in the efforts she led to try to

     reach conclusions. It was her and Alice Perkins, as Chair, who insisted on the

     business investigating in detail.


146. On a personal level, I will forever be grateful to Ms Vennells for the support

     she showed for me when I learned I was facing serious illness and I know

     many others, including postmasters, will say the same.



147. Alice Perkins as Chair of Post Office also, it seemed to me, wished only to

     find a way to resolve these issues appropriately and sought to do so

     tenaciously and with great care and an eye for detail.



148. I would also like to mention Angela Van Den Bogerd. I found her to be

     incredibly committed to public service and to the Post Office. She was

     detailed, thorough and empathetic. She was also, it seemed to me, committed

     to getting to the truth, hampered by lack of the information we now have to

     hand.


149. As for me, I am not a technical or legal expert and had to rely on what I (and

     others) believed in good faith to be the case. I did not, as been alleged, seek

     to "cover up" issues with Horizon - indeed quite the opposite. But because I

     did not have access to a►l the facts, I clearly played a part in prolonging the

     pain and injustice for those innocent people who were wrongly accused or

     whose convictions were unsafe. I am deeply sorry for that.
