                        POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




             FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF TERESA WILLIAMSON




I, Teresa Williamson, will say as follows:-



INTRODUCTION


   1. I am a former employee of the Post Office. I was employed by the Post Office

       initially as a lawyer in February 1992 then as a senior lawyer from 1995/1996

       through to the end of 2005. The Post Office changed its name to Consignia

       in 2001 and then to Royal Mail Group plc shortly afterwards.


   2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

       (the "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 9 June

       2023 (the "Request"). The focus of this statement is my position as a

       prosecutor within the Criminal Law team at the Post Office and the

       prosecution of Lisa Brennan.


   3. I have instructed PCB-Byrne LLP to act on my behalf in relation to the

       Request. I have been assisted by Michael Potts and Sam Russell, who are

                                                                                  WITN08680100




    lawyers at PCB-Byrne, in responding to the Request.



BACKGROUND


 4. Prior to joining the Post Office, I had worked as a criminal defence solicitor at

    Desmond Wright and Co Solicitors, which was based in Hayes. I joined this

    firm in 1987, after leaving law school, and qualified as a solicitor in 1990.

    Once I qualified as a solicitor, my case load almost exclusively involved

    defending individuals who had been accused of criminal offences across a

    spectrum of general crime cases, funded through legal aid. I also worked on

    a very small number of private prosecutions, relating to dangerous dogs, but

    do not have much recollection about the details of those cases.



 5. Part of my role as a criminal defence lawyer involved being a duty solicitor,

    which meant that I was often called to the police station at unsociable hours.

    After two years in this role, I started to look for other jobs that had more

    conventional working hours, which would be better suited to my family life. I

    interviewed at the Crown Prosecution Service and the Post Office and I was

    offered a position by the Post Office in the Criminal Law team.



 6. I joined this team in February 1992 as a lawyer. My role involved prosecuting

    cases across the different parts of the business including for the Post Office,

    Royal Mail, Parcelforce and other smaller entities from time to time.



 7. Around 1995/1996, I was promoted to the position of senior lawyer within the

    same Criminal Law team. My role did not change significantly on promotion,


                                  Page 2 of 36
                                                                                WITNO8680100
                                                                              WITN08680100




   and I remained responsible for prosecuting cases. The only real difference

   was that I would have taken on more supervisory duties and my work would

   have been subject to much less supervision. I provide more detail of the

   nature of my work as a prosecutor at paragraphs 13 to 24 below.



8. My son was born in 1996 and, after returning from maternity leave, I started

   working a four-day week. I also had to take ad-hoc days off regularly to deal

   with some        GRQ                    for the remainder of my employment

   with the Post Office. This did mean that there would have been occasions

   where I may have missed a training session (see paragraph 29 below) or that

   other colleagues had to cover my cases whilst I was away.



9. By 2003, I started to consider moving on from my position in the Criminal

   Law team. By this point, I did little advocacy as most court work was

   outsourced to local agents or junior counsel. There was also less variety of

   work, as lawyers were increasingly given the same type of cases, as an

   attempt to increase efficiency. The role had become more of a desk job and

   I needed a new challenge.



10. Towards the end of 2003, an opportunity arose to join the Employment Team

   at the Post Office. I thought this was a fantastic opportunity to learn and

   develop skills in a new area of law, which I thought I would find interesting,

   so I accepted the offer to move teams. The employment team was divided

   into two sub-teams: operational and corporate. I sat in the operational team

   with about five other lawyers and mainly dealt with employment tribunal work.



                               Page 3 of 36
                                                                                     WITNO8680100
                                                                                WITNO8680100




 11. While I was in the Employment team, I had very little interaction with the

    Criminal Law team. I did not carry on working on any cases after I made the

    move; although I may have responded to internal enquiries from criminal

    team members that concerned cases that I had previously worked on.



 12. 1 left Royal Mail Group plc around Christmas 2005. There was a wave of

    redundancies and I was offered a termination package. I decided it was a

    good time to leave and pursue other opportunities. Since working for     Royal

    Mail Group plc, I spent about five academic years working as a tutor at BPP

    University. I've also trained as an acupuncturist and currently work as a

    coordinator for a charity and I am chair of an advisory board for an

    acupuncture college.



PROSECUTORIAL WORK


 13. Throughout my time working as a prosecutor at the Post office, I dealt with a

    large variety of cases, some of which included theft (including theft of mail),

    wilful delay of mail, robbery, fraud and false accounting. Given the passage

    of time, I cannot now recall how many cases I would have prosecuted across

    my time in the Criminal Law team.



 14. Similarly, I cannot recall how many would have specifically related to theft

    and/or false accounting that involved data generated by Horizon. Based on

    the documents disclosed along with the Request, I can see that I prosecuted

    at least one such case, being R v Brennan. I believe there may have been


                                 Page 4 of 36
                                                                                 WITNO8680100
                                                                               WITN08680100




   other cases, but I am unable to recall any specifics given the passage of time.

   I have asked for disclosure of any other cases that I may have prosecuted to

   assist my recollection of specific events. At the time of making this statement

   I await a response from the Inquiry.



15. When I first joined the Criminal Law team at the Post Office in 1992, the team

   was led by Mike Heath and my direct line manager and supervisor was Roger

   Williams. I was also supervised by Rob Wilson after Roger's departure. I

   cannot recall the date of Roger's departure. To start with, the level of my

   supervision was relatively high. Most of my work would be checked prior to

   being finalised. As I gained more experience prosecuting cases and

   demonstrated that I could carry out the work to a high standard to my

   supervisors, the level of supervision steadily decreased until it became

   minimal as I progressed to a senior lawyer role.



16. When I became a senior lawyer in 1995/1996, I took on some supervisory

   duties. My style of supervision was similar to those who supervised me: I

   would check work before it was finalised, until I started to become confident

   that the lawyer or articled clerk was able to carry out the work to a high

   standard themselves. It would probably be fair to say that I was more hands

   on than the average supervisor.


17. When I started, there were probably around ten lawyers in the team in total,

   along with a few support staff including junior legal executives, who

   essentially performed the role of paralegals, and secretaries. There was a

   slight reduction in staff numbers over the course of my employment in the


                                Page 5 of 36
                                                                                 WITN08680100
                                                                               WITNO8680100




   team, as there was a wave of redundancies in the late 1990s/early 2000s. By

   the time I left the team in 2003, it would have included roughly eight lawyers.


18. Each lawyer within the team was given their own caseload and it would have

   been normal for each lawyer to be working on several different cases at any

   one time. Aside from supervision of the articled clerk and more junior lawyer,

   each member of the team tended to work autonomously on their cases and

   there was generally very little collaboration. You could, however, seek

   assistance from junior legal executives, who normally helped with the

   administrative aspects of cases.



19. My role as a prosecutor of a case would have typically involved the ten steps

   set out below.

       •   Step 1: reviewing the case file, which would have been compiled by

           an investigator and included a note of the interview with the suspect,

           the antecedents, any evidence relevant to the case and a

           memorandum drafted by the investigating officer (such as document

           POL00047325). On reviewing the file, my focus would have been on

           considering the strength of the evidence in the case in accordance

           with the evidential test in the Code for Crown Prosecutors which was

           used by the Criminal Team to assess whether a case met the

           threshold for prosecution or not.

       •   Step 2: corresponding with the investigator to clarify certain points

           within the evidence or seek further evidence if appropriate. I would

           often point out further lines of enquiry that should be considered. The

           nature and scale of this correspondence would have been entirely


                                Page 6 of 36
                                                                             WITNO8680100
                                                                           WITN08680100




    dependent on each specific case.

    Step 3: drafting a written advice to a regional (or area) manager

    providing my opinion on why a prosecution is, or is not, appropriate in

    accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors with a particular

    focus on whether there is a realistic prospect of conviction. If I advised

    that there was a realistic prospect of conviction, I would have also

    included my opinion on the likelihood of success in this advice, along

    with the relevant charges and a summary of facts to be served on the

    defence. If I advised that there was not a reasonable prospect of

    conviction, the case would have been brought to a close at this stage.

    I should make it clear that I was only providing an opinion, I was not

    the decision maker. My written advice would be sent to the       regional

    manager for an actual decision on charge.

•   Step 4: attending the first appearance. Once the regional manager

    had authorised the decision to charge (if advised), the investigator

    would apply for the summons. If the first appearance was in the

    greater London or South East area, I may have attended the

    magistrates' court (at least at the start of my career before a decision

    was made to outsource most court work). If it had been further afield,

    I would have instructed a local agent or junior counsel to attend on

    the Post Office's behalf. I would have also sent the summary of facts

    that I had prepared to the defendant or their solicitor.

•   Step 5: reviewing the committal papers. The investigator in the case

    would have provided a file with all the witness statements (which

    would have been drafted by the investigator) and exhibits. I would

                                                                         WITNO8680100




    have reviewed these documents with the primary focus of ensuring

    that there was a case to answer. I would have also wanted to

    familiarise myself with the key issues in the case so that I was able to

    go on to consider disclosure issues. My reading of the case papers

    would assist my assessment of whether any unused material may

    undermine the Prosecution case or assist the Defence case.

•   Step 6: if appropriate, corresponding with the investigator in order to

    ensure that any mistakes or omissions in the committal papers were

    corrected. This could have been as simple as a quick phone call to

    highlight a small problem or might have formed part of a written

    advice.

•   Step 7: reviewing the unused material schedules. The disclosure

    officer in the case was always the investigator. They would provide

    three schedules relating to disclosure, typically at the same time as

    providing the committal papers. These schedules included: a

    schedule of non-sensitive unused material, which should have

    included a list of all the relevant material (aside from any privileged

    material) that did not form part of evidence in the case; a schedule of

    sensitive material, which should have included any relevant privileged

    material that did not form part of the evidence in the case; and the

    disclosure officer's report, which was an internal document detailing

    the disclosure officer's analysis of the material that should be

    disclosed to the defence. My role was to check these schedules to

    ensure that    all relevant material had been included and to assess

    whether I agreed with the disclosure officer's view of what should be



                         Page 8 of 36
                                                                                WITNO8680100
                                                                              WITNO8680100




           disclosed or made available for inspection. There was a section on

           the form where the reviewing lawyer could leave any comments

           relating to the disclosure officer's decisions. I may also have

           subsequently corresponded or spoken with the disclosure officer if I

           had comments in terms of follow up matters or wished to challenge

           any disclosure issues.

           Step 8: sending the committal papers to the defence solicitor, local

           agents and the magistrates' court for the committal hearing. I would

           have sent the primary disclosure to the defence solicitor and agents

           with the committal papers.

       •   Step 9: drafting the indictment, along with preparing the brief to

           counsel and instructions to advise on evidence shortly after

           committal. Generally, I would ask counsel to draft the indictment on

           my behalf, if the case was complex.

       •   Step 10: reviewing the defence case statement, if served. As with

           primary disclosure, the investigator (and disclosure officer) in the

           case would have prepared a further disclosure report, detailing any

           further documents that fell to be disclosed. I would have reviewed the

           work of the disclosure officer and provided any comments on

           secondary disclosure if appropriate.



20. At this point my involvement in the case would have typically ended with any

   further administrative preparation for trial carried out by a junior legal

   executive, who would liaise directly with the Crown Court, counsel, the local

   agents and the investigator. I would have only become involved if any



                                Page 9 of 36
                                                                                     WITNO8680100
                                                                                   WITNO8680100




   substantive legal issues arose, such as a defence statement being served,

   or if the junior legal executive had encountered a problem.



21. That said, when I first joined the Post Office, I would regularly attend court for

   magistrates' hearings and would carry out the advocacy if the case was being

   tried locally in London or the South East instead of outsourcing the job to a

   local agent or junior counsel. However, this became much less typical after a

   few years of working at the Post Office, as management decided that it was

   more financially viable to outsource most advocacy. I cannot recall exactly

   when this change took place. We would always have instructed barristers on

   cases tried at a Crown Court, even when it was more normal for Post Office

   lawyers to carry out advocacy. I did not have higher rights of audience in the

   Crown Court.



22. In addition to supervision, I would have had some training to assist me in

   carrying out my role as a prosecutor. There was some internal training but it

   was largely down to the individual lawyer to sign on to external training

   sessions in order to ensure they were meeting their continuing professional

   development (the "CPD") requirements. I enjoyed attending training courses

   and would regularly attend training sessions that I thought were relevant to

   my work. I always met my Solicitors Regulation Authority (the "SRA") CPD

   requirements.



23.There were also templates to assist lawyers in drafting letters or advice.

   Lawyers could use these templates and were at complete liberty to change



                                 Page 10 of 36
                                                                                     WITNO8680100
                                                                                   WITNO8680100




    them as they thought appropriate. I would alter them quite significantly to fit

    with my own style.



 24. 1 do not recall there being any specific company policies relevant to the

    Criminal Law team. However, we adopted the legal guidance and framework

    that governed the conduct of a prosecution at any given time. This would

    have      included the Code of Crown Prosecutors, the Criminal Procedure and

    Investigations Act and its protocols and any other contemporaneous

    legislation that was applicable to prosecuting cases. The head of the Criminal

    Law team was responsible for overseeing the overall conduct of the

    prosecution. As stated previously, this would have been Mike Heath when I

    first started working at the Post Office, then Rob Wilson, after he took over

    the role from Mike.



BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE OF THE HORIZON IT SYSTEM


 25. At some point in the late 1990s/early 2000s, I would have become aware that

    the Post Office intended to introduce the Horizon IT accounting system. I

    probably would have become aware of this development by reading the

    weekly news update, which I think was called the Post Office Gazette, that

    was circulated to all Post Office staff. I did not give it a lot of thought at the

    time. I did not know exactly when the system started to become operational

    and was not aware of the reasons for any delays in the rolling out of the

    system.



 26. Prior to 12 July 2002, my understanding of the Horizon IT system was very


                                 Page 11 of 36
                                                                                    WITNO8680100
                                                                                  WITN08680100




   basic. I knew it was a computerised bookkeeping system designed to assist

   subpostmasters with the processing of various payments and also balancing

   on a weekly basis. I recall that, at the time the system was being rolled out,

   there was a general message within the organisation that it was a

   sophisticated and high-quality technology.



27. Consequently, I always assumed it was reliable and was never given any

   reason to doubt the accuracy of the technology. This was during a period

   when technology was steadily becoming a more important feature of working

   life and I think there was a general understanding that, like most technological

   advances, it was being introduced to make the work easier and more efficient

   but not at the cost of accuracy. If anything, we believed that any

   computerisation of systems would have made them more accurate than

   manual entry which is always prone to error.



28.I did not ever think to question the accuracy of the technology while I was

   working at the Post Office. I did not have the required expertise in technology

   to properly understand the mechanics of the system and, even if I had done,

   I was never involved in any conversations or discussions about how the

   system operated between the branch post offices and Fujitsu. To the best of

   my recollection, I never attended a local post office branch to see the system

   in practice.



29.There was some training on the Horizon system around the time it was

   implemented into individual branch offices. I don't think I attended the training;

   I cannot remember why exactly but it is possible that it fell on one of my non-

   working days or I was out of the office looking after my son. I believe the

   training was specifically for the Criminal Law team, but because I did not

   attend, I cannot be certain; it is possible that members of other teams also

   attended. I did not have an opportunity to attend another session. I cannot

   remember if I asked about attending another session but if there had been

   one, I am fairly certain that I would have attended. I think the point of the

   training was to show lawyers how to use the system, as if we were working

   in the subpostoffice, so we would be able to understand how it could be used

   as evidence in any future cases.



30. It is unlikely that I discussed the training with any of my colleagues, or even

   spoke about the Horizon system more generally with them. As mentioned, we

   tended to work individually on cases and operated in siloes. It was very rare

   that we discussed cases as a team. We did regularly go to lunch together,

   but this typically involved more social conversation. Between Horizon's

   implementation to when I left the team in 2003, I was never party to, or aware

   of, any conversation within the legal team questioning the accuracy of the

   Horizon system.



31. During my time working at the Post Office, I was never aware of any actual

   or potential bugs, errors, defects or other problems with Horizon. My first

   knowledge of any issues with the system was when I read the Computer

   Weekly article in 2009 long after I had left my employment at Royal Mail legal

   services. I bought a copy of the magazine from WH Smith when it was

    published. On reading the article, I felt shocked, horrified and physically

    nauseous.

33. However, there are a number of important documents, which I believe would

   have been created, that have not been provided. Some of these documents

   include:

       •   My correspondence with Steve Bradshaw relating to the evidence in

           the case;



                                Page 16 of 36
                                                                                   WITNO8680100
                                                                                 WITNO8680100




        •   My memorandum dated 13 November 2002;

        •   My advice in response to the disclosure schedules;

        •   My communication with the investigator in the case, Steve Bradshaw,

            including attendance notes of our calls that are referred to in the

            documentation;

        •   My brief to counsel and any request for advice on the evidence in the

            case.



34. I believe these documents, and possibly others, would set out my opinion on

   the strength of the case and any issues with the evidence or disclosure.

   Consequently, the provision of these documents would greatly assist my

   ability to answer some of the questions asked by the Inquiry in the Request.

   I appreciate these documents may not be in the Inquiry's possession and I

   will do my best to assist the Inquiry in providing details of this prosecution

   based on the documents provided and my own, albeit vague, recollection of

   the documents not provided.



35. It is worth noting at the outset that throughout the prosecution of this case, I

   believed that the Horizon system was working properly. I did not have an idea

   of even the possibility that the Horizon system was creating inaccurate data.

   If I had any sense that there was a problem with the system, I would have:


        •   Sought further evidence from the investigators to ensure that I fully

            understood the nature of the issues and how they impacted the

            evidence in the case;

        •   Considered whether any such evidence meant that there was not a


                                Page 17 of 36
                                                                                    WITNO8680100
                                                                                  WITN08680100




           realistic prospect of conviction in the case; and

           if I felt the evidence still supported a realistic prospect of conviction,

           disclosed any relevant details of the problems with the system to the

           defence.



36.Around late June or early July 2002, I would have been allocated the Lisa

   Brennan case file by my team leader, Rob Wilson. File allocation was typically

   based on the capacity of the lawyers within the team. I would have had

   significant experience in prosecuting allegations of this type of pension fraud,

   including under the old pre-Horizon paper-based system.



37.On a general level, I did not notice any obvious differences between the

   number and nature of these types of cases from those that had been carried

   out before Horizon was introduced. The key difference was that the evidence

   of discrepancies was provided by the Horizon data, rather than evidenced in

   a human audit or paper-based documents.



38. The case file that would have been given to me would have included:

       •   Steve Bradshaw's memorandum to Jan Mullin (POL00047324);

       •   Steve Bradshaw's summary of the investigation (POL00047525),

           including the schedules to this summary (Appendix B, detailing the

           discrepancies identified and Appendix C, the copy tapes) which were

           not provided in the disclosure;

       •   The Antecedents form (POL00047326);

       •   Summaries of the interview (POL00047322; POL00047323). It was



                                Page 18 of 36
                                                                                 WITNO8680100
                                                                               WITN08680100




           not uncommon for further summaries of the interviews to be created

           on the request of either the prosecution or the defence. An

           administrator in the Security and Investigations team would typically

           listen to the tape and produce a new summary clarifying the point in

           question. I cannot recall exactly which version of these documents I

           would have reviewed in this file; it could have also been

           POL00047521 and POL00047522, which appear to be slightly

           different versions of the same summaries. On occasions, either the

           defence or prosecution, might have also requested a full transcript of

           the interview, which appears to have happened in this case

           (POL00047320), but is unlikely to have been provided with the

           original case file.



39. Lawyers were typically expected to review the file and provide their initial

   opinion on whether charges could be brought against a suspect within 14

   days of receiving the file. My initial memorandum to Steve Bradshaw

   (POL00047331) is dated 12 July 2002, so assuming I stuck to this deadline,

   I would have reviewed this file anytime between 29 June 2002 and 12 July

   2002.



40. On review of the file, I would have noticed that the only direct evidence of a

   pension fraud was contained in the Horizon data discrepancies. As explained

   above, I had no reason to doubt the accuracy of these discrepancies.

   However, initially, I did not think there was enough evidence to support the

   explanation for these discrepancies being that Ms Brennan had intentionally



                                 Page 19 of 36
                                                                                   WITN08680100
                                                                                 WITNO8680100




   carried out a fraud.



41. I explained my main concerns with the evidence in my memorandum dated

   12 July 2002 (POL00047331). The purpose of this document was to allow

   Steve Bradshaw to carry out further investigations to see if it was possible to

   address the issues with the evidence that I had identified. In the

   memorandum, I did not request any details about whether Horizon was

   operating accurately because I assumed it was and Ms Brennan had not

   questioned the accuracy of the data in her interview. If she had, or if I had

   any reason to doubt the Horizon system, I would have asked for the accuracy

   of the data to be checked in addition to the other points raised.



42. In this document, I refer to the "minute from Steve Bradshaw". I am fairly

   certain that this refers to POL00047325. At this point, I would only have seen

   the documents included in the case file, so it is highly unlikely that I would

   have been referring to anything else.



43. I would sometimes call the investigator prior to sending the advice, especially

   in circumstances where I did not think the evidence was strong enough to

   recommend a charging decision. There was no requirement to make any

   such call, but I thought it was a polite step that helped maintain good

   relationships with investigators.



44. 1 may have made a similar call in this instance: if I did, it would more or less

   have reiterated the points in the 12 July 2002 advice. It is likely that Steve



                                Page 20 of 36
                                                                                      WITNO8680100
                                                                                    WITN08680100




   Bradshaw or myself would have created an attendance note of any such call,

   which, if it exists, has not been provided to me by the Inquiry.



45. After sending the 12 July memorandum to Steve Bradshaw, it is unlikely that

   I had any further involvement with this case until receiving Mr Bradshaw's

   response on 31 July 2002 (POL00047335). We may have spoken on the

   phone at some point in the intervening period, but it is impossible for me to

   confirm this without viewing any copies of attendance notes.



46. 1 cannot recall whether, at the time, I thought Mr Bradshaw's response

   adequately addressed the questions in my 12 July memorandum. However,

   on reviewing the rest of the disclosure, it appears that it did not, as Mr

   Bradshaw provided a further memorandum relating to the checks conducted

   dated 7 October (POL00047340).



47. It is likely that this further memorandum would have been provided in

   response to a further advice written by me about the persisting issues with

   the evidence in the case. On reviewing the 31 July 2002 (POL00047335)

   memorandum, it is likely that I would have sent the file back to Mr Bradshaw,

   along with this further advice. It would then have been up to Mr Bradshaw to

   carry out further investigations to address these issues.



48. While I am almost certain that I still did not think there was a realistic prospect

   of conviction at this point, I did believe that certain inferences could be drawn

   about the case that pointed towards the potential guilt of Ms Brennan. I say



                                 Page 21 of 36
                                                                                    WITNO8680100
                                                                                  WITN08680100




   "almost certain" because I cannot recall my state of mind at the time, but,

   having reviewed the documents disclosed, it appears clear to me that this

   would have been my state of mind. I recall thinking it was strange that the

   discrepancies only appeared in relation to Ms Brennan's date stamp on the

   pension and allowance claims and that Ms Brennan could not recall her

   recent holiday when questioned about it at interview. I understood that there

   had been no pension and allowance discrepancies while Ms Brennan was on

   holiday. Consequently, I would have wanted to give Steve Bradshaw an

   opportunity to address deficiencies in the evidence.



49. It appears that a similar interaction between myself and Mr Bradshaw

   occurred on receipt of the 7 October 2002 memorandum (POL00047340).

   Again, I cannot remember my thoughts at the time of receiving this

   memorandum, however, it appears that it still did not adequately address my

   concerns with the evidence, as Mr Bradshaw provided a further

   memorandum, relating to the checks carried out, dated November

   (POL00047475). Both the October and November memoranda relate to

   checks being carried out to identify any shortfall in stock and so, on this basis,

   I believe that my main concerns with the evidence at this point related to the

   nature of the discrepancies identified. However, I cannot be sure of this

   without having sight of my communications with Mr Bradshaw during this

   period.



50. My knowledge of the investigations made into whether shortfalls had been

   identified is limited to details provided in the disclosure. It is clear that the



                                Page 22 of 36
                                                                                   WITN08680100
                                                                                 WITNO8680100




   Department for Social Security at Lishally had initially identified the

   discrepancies, which in turn triggered the investigation within the Post Office.

   It is also clear that Steve Bradshaw carried out further investigations into the

   discrepancies; the results of which are provided in his memorand          a of 7

   October 2002 (POL00047340) and 5 November 2002 (POL00047475).

   Unfortunately, I cannot recall any more detail about this.



51. Similarly, I cannot recall the details of the telephone conversations that I had

   with Steve Bradshaw on either 4 October 2002 or 4 November 2002.

   However, I strongly suspect they were about the checks he had been carrying

   out to identify the shortfall, detailed in POL00047340 and POL00047475, and

   whether these sufficiently addressed my concerns relating to the deficiencies

   of the evidence in the case. There should be an attendance note of these

   calls and it would assist my recollection if they could be disclosed by the

   Inquiry to me.



52. It would appear that in light of receiving the 5 November 2002 memorandum,

   I became satisfied that the evidence was strong enough to afford a realistic

   prospect of conviction in this case (being more than 50%), as there is no

   further back and forth about the evidence between myself and Mr Bradshaw

   in the disclosure. Unfortunately, I cannot recall exactly what it was about this

   memorandum, and the further checks, that meant I felt satisfied with the

   evidence. It is too long ago to recall such detail.



53. At this point, I would have drafted an advice to the regional manager about



                                Page 23 of 36
                                                                                  WITNO8680100
                                                                                WITNO8680100




   the decision as to whether to bring charges against Ms Brennan. I would need

   to see this document to be certain of my thought processes at this point. It

   seems highly likely that this advice is the document dated 13 November 2002,

   referred to at question 20.3 of the Request.



54. However, to the best of my recollection, I believe that I advised that both the

   evidential and public interest tests in the Code for Crown Prosecutors were

   satisfied in this case, and charges could be authorised by the regional

   manager against Ms Brennan if that decision was going to be made by him.



55.I would have set out my reasoning for this position, including the strengths

   and weaknesses of the evidence. I think I believed that although there was

   no direct evidence to suggest that Ms Brennan had stolen the money, the

   shortfalls identified by the Horizon data, along with the fact Ms Brennan was

   known to be a competent member of staff, was enough for a court to infer

   that she had committed theft. A further inference could be drawn on the basis

   that all the discrepancies related to her pension and allowance claims and

   they only occurred when Ms Brennan was in the office. As stated above, I

   also remember thinking it was odd that she had not been upfront about her

   holiday. I seem to recall advising that it was not the strongest case, but that

   it did pass the evidential test.



56.I do not recall there being any relevant public interest considerations in this

   case. Consequently, it is possible that I did not include a specific analysis of

   the public interest test in my advice. I would have also included an advice on



                                 Page 24 of 36
                                                                                  WITNO8680100
                                                                                 WITNO8680100




   whether charges could be made and a summary of facts in the case. This

   summary would form the advance information to be served on the defendant

   or their solicitor prior to the first appearance in the magistrates' court.



57.As previously mentioned, at the time of drafting this advice I was not aware

   of any bugs, errors, defects or problems with the Horizon system. I assumed

   the data that formed the key basis for the decision to prosecute Ms Brennan

   was entirely accurate. Had I known then, what I know now about the Horizon

   system, it is almost certain that this advice would have recommended that no

   further action was taken against Ms Brennan.



58. My advice would have also included any further steps that could be carried

   out by investigators to improve the likelihood of conviction. For example, it

   appears, from question 20.3 of the Request, that I requested a witness

   statement confirming the accuracy of the Horizon data. I made this request

   not because I doubted the accuracy of the data in any way, but because I

   always took a thorough approach to my prosecutorial duties. At the time, had

   such a statement been drafted, I fully anticipated that it would have simply

   confirmed that the data forming the basis of the prosecution was accurate.



59. Had I thought anything else, I would have been much clearer and vociferous

   in conveying the importance of investigating the accuracy of the Horizon data

   to Steve Bradshaw. I would not have felt ready to draft my advice on the

   charging decision until any such investigations had been completed.

                                                                              WITNO8680100




60.On receiving my advice, the regional manager would have then authorised

   the decision to charge Ms Brennan with the recommended offence(s). I had

   no relationship with the regional manager and it was typical for them to

   approve the recommendation in the advice without asking any further

   questions. I do not recall there being any disagreements about the decision

   to prosecute Ms Brennan.



61. After this decision had been made, it is clear from the disclosure that Rob

   Wilson instructed agents in Liverpool to attend the magistrates' court for the

   first appearance (POL00047480). I would have normally done this myself but

   clearly was not able to do so for one reason or another. It is likely that the

   agent in question provided a short update after the first appearance, which

   seemingly took place at Liverpool Magistrates' Court on 6 February 2003.



62. 1 would not have had any substantive involvement in the case until the

   investigator, Steve Bradshaw, sent me a draft pack of the committal papers,

   along with his memorandum dated 14 March 2003 (POL00047505). This

   would have included all the witness statements that had been drafted by that

   date and the exhibits.


63. At the same time, Steve Bradshaw would have sent me three documents

   relating to disclosure: the Schedule of Non-Sensitive Unused Material

   (POL00047517); the Disclosure Officer's Report (POL00047491); and a

   Schedule of Sensitive Material (POL00047492). Steve Bradshaw was the

   disclosure officer in this case. I should say that the documents provided to

   me are clearly drafts and I do not know whether they are first drafts or later

                                                                               WITN08680100




   versions but I have not seen the final signed versions so it is much more

   difficult to analyse what I may have or have not commented upon.



64. While I cannot remember my review of these documents, it is highly likely that

   in the first instance, I would have gone through the committal papers to make

   sure that there was a case to answer. While doing this, I would have

   familiarised myself with the key issues and evidence in the case, so that I was

   also in a position to check the disclosure officer's schedules.


65.I would then have checked that everything in the case file that I had been

   provided with was included on either the Non-Sensitive Schedule of Unused

   or the Sensitive Schedule of Unused unless the item was a witness statement

   or exhibit. I would have also gone through both the Sensitive and Non-

   Sensitive unused to check that documents had been correctly categorised as

   privileged or not.


66. The Disclosure Officer's Report (POL00047491) was an internal document

   that contained the disclosure officer's position on which documents should be

   disclosed. In the draft provided, it appears that Mr Bradshaw did not think any

   documents fell to be disclosed. I would have checked the schedules of Non-

   Sensitive and Sensitive Unused material to confirm whether I agreed with this

   analysis. In the event anything was missing or incorrect, I would have asked

   Mr Bradshaw to correct the appropriate schedule or locate the relevant

   document. There was also a section on the forms where I could have

   entered my comments such as whether an item should be disclosed or made

   available for inspection. As I do not have the final signed versions I cannot



                               Page 27 of 36
                                                                                   WITNO8680100
                                                                                 WITN08680100




   see if there was any disagreement between Mr Bradshaw and me but if there

   were I would have expected him to follow my guidance.


67. It is worth noting that on my initial review of the schedules of unused, I would

   have been primarily focused on checking that the disclosure officer had

   correctly identified any material that could undermine the prosecution case or

   assist any defence made by the defendant at interview. If, at any point, the

   defendant served a defence case statement, the disclosure officer would

   have conducted a secondary disclosure exercise, which I would have

   checked much in the same way, focusing on whether anything else that might

   assist the defence case had been correctly identified. I cannot recall if a

   defence case statement was served in this case.



68.As I have said, the schedules disclosed with the Request (POL00047517;

   POL00047491; POL00047492) appear to be in draft form and the disclosure

   does not include any document that details my response to Steve Bradshaw's

   14 March 2003 memorandum. Consequently, I am not able to say whether I

   provided any further advice to Mr Bradshaw on the committal papers or the

   disclosure schedules. It was common for there to be a back and forth between

   myself and the investigator, until I was happy that the committal bundle was

   ready to be served on the defence and the disclosure schedules were correct.



69.As I have also said, there should be a signed version of the disclosure

   schedules, including my signature. I would have been satisfied that those

   versions of the schedules were correct and disclosure obligations had been

   completed.

70. In his memorandum dated 14 March 2003 (POL00047505), Steve Bradshaw

   says "Concerning point 4 of your memo dated 13 November 2002. I have

   spoken to Sonia Cassidy at Lishally in Northern Ireland. She informs me that

   this type of statement [is] not normally done and the matter has been

   discussed previously with Colin Justice". I believe he is essentially saying that

   it has not been possible to have a witness statement drafted by a

   representative of the Department of Social Security at Lisally confirming the

   accuracy of the Horizon data, as I requested in my 13 November 2002

   memorandum. It is difficult to provide any further detail about this request

   without seeing the memorandum in question.


71. My sense is that I would have been reluctant to accept this answer. However,

   I cannot remember my response and there is little point speculating. It

   appears that the statement was never drafted so ultimately, I must have

   accepted that it could not be done in time for 3 April 2003, which was the

   deadline for serving the committal papers.


72.After the committal papers and schedules of unused material had been

   finalised, I would have instructed counsel. I can see in this case John Gibson

   was instructed. I would have sent the brief to counsel and instructions to

   advise on evidence to his chambers that we used in Liverpool rather than

   instructing him directly. It is also possible that I drafted the indictment

   (POL00066714); although counsel would also often do this and I cannot

   remember who drafted it in this case.


73. From this point onwards, my involvement in this case would have been


                                Page 29 of 36
                                                                                 WITN08680100
                                                                                WITNO8680100




   minimal. A junior legal executive in the team, being Jenny Andrews in this

   case, would have dealt directly with the investigator, agents, counsel and the

   Crown Court. I would have only become involved if any issues arose.



74. For example, if there had been any "plea-bargaining", I would have expected

   to be involved in this process with the regional manager making the final

   decision on any agreement reached. That said, issues could crop up at the

   very last minute in criminal cases and communication was more difficult in

   2003, so it is possible that counsel would have dealt with any such issues

   directly. I cannot remember any plea-bargaining taking place in this case.



75. I have been provided with a memorandum sent by Steve Bradshaw to John

   Gibson dated 3 June 2003 (POL00047515). John Gibson was the barrister I

   instructed in this case and it appears that this correspondence was born out

   of a request made by him as he prepared for the trial. I cannot remember if I

   saw this document at the time. I am not sure why Mr Bradshaw sent this

   document directly to Mr Gibson; any communications with counsel should,

   and would typically, have come through myself of the junior legal executive,

   Jenny Andrews. It is possible that Mr Bradshaw did copy this memorandum

   to Ms Andrews, and it was agreed that he should send it directly to the

   barrister, however, I cannot remember for sure.



76. Similarly, it seems that the memorandum from Steve Bradshaw to Jenny

   Andrews, dated 10 June 2003 (POL00047516) is also born out of a request

   from counsel in his preparation for trial. It is unlikely that I saw this

    memorandum at the time and cannot comment on it further.



 77. Any advice that I gave on the collation of evidence would have been included

    in the various memoranda that I drafted throughout the case. I have only been

    provided with the memorandum dated 12 July 2002 (POL00047331). I believe

    I would have drafted further memoranda or pieces of advice to Steve

    Bradshaw over the next few months in September/October, a memorandum

    to the regional manager dated 13 November 2002 and a memorandum in

    response to the submission of the draft committal papers and schedules of

    unused material in March or April 2003. I would need to see those documents

    to comment further.



 78. As stated, I was not aware of any bugs, errors, defects or problems with the

    Horizon system at any point throughout my involvement in this prosecution. I

    did not become aware of any issues until reading the Computer Weekly article

    in 2009. At the time, I believed that this prosecution was carried out fairly in

    accordance with the legal framework in place at the time; it was essentially

    the same as every other prosecution that I was involved in during my time at

    the Post Office.



JOSEPHINE HAMILTON & OTHERS v POST OFFICE LIMITED JUDGEMENT


 79. 1 have recently reviewed the Josephine Hamilton & Others v Post Office

    Limited [2021 EWCA Grim 577] at POL00113278, which has enhanced my

    knowledge of some of the issues with the Horizon system. It is clear that there

    were numerous issues with the system that had been identified from an early


                                 Page 31 of 36
                                                                                 WITNO8680100
                                                                               WITN08680100




   stage. I agree with the findings at paragraphs 286 to 290.



80. I am frustrated that these issues were not communicated to criminal lawyers

   prosecuting cases at the time. As a lawyer, my priority had always been to

   apply the law and guidance fairly, whether that pointed me towards advising

   on charges or no further action. I trusted that the Post Office had created an

   environment where I could do this to the best of my ability; however, it is now

   clear that it had not. I personally feel let down by any individuals who failed

   to share this information with prosecutors or the Criminal Law team generally.



81. It is also clear that there were more structural problems with the working

   culture at the Post Office that prevented the open and transparent sharing of

   information. It was very hierarchical and there was limited communication

   between the different strata of the organisation. Even the Criminal Law team

   adopted a culture in which we typically kept our work to ourselves and did not

   communicate openly as a wider team. I think this undoubtedly played a part

   in ensuring that the issues with Horizon were obstructed for so long.



82. From my perspective as a lawyer, knowledge of these issues would have

   changed my approach to any prosecutions that I conducted involving Horizon

   data. My priority would have been to identify and understand the issues with

   the system and then assess whether these issues undermined the

   prosecution case. I would have wanted statements taken from Fujitsu,

   detailing the mechanics of the system. I would not have been scared to push

   back on deadlines or ask for significant work and analysis to be carried out

                                                                                       WITN08680100




     by investigators to ensure that all the issues were identified and properly

     understood.



  83.I always tried to be a meticulous lawyer, who applied the law and guidance

     carefully even if it meant giving advice that would have frustrated

     investigators. I gained no satisfaction from bringing charges against

     individuals, especially given my background as a defence lawyer. I have little

     doubt that in the Lisa Brennan case I would have advised that there was not

     a realistic prospect of conviction due to issues with the Horizon data had I

     known them at the time.



  84.I feel absolutely devastated that Ms Brennan was charged and convicted of

     theft. I feel gutted that I was unwittingly part of a horrible miscarriage of justice

     and am so sorry for the awful impact it has had on her life. I am incredibly

     glad that convictions have been overturned in this judgement and Ms

     Brennan has sought compensation for the ordeal that she has been through.



  85. With all that said, aside from retrospectively changing the culture of the Post

     Office to ensure that issues with Horizon were shared with the Criminal Law

     team, I do not think there is anything that we could have reasonably done

     differently at the time in relation to the prosecution of Lisa Brennan. Within a

     framework of not knowing about the issues with Horizon, the law and

     guidance was applied fairly at every stage.

   86. There is one further point that I consider relevant to Phase 4 of the Inquiry_

         After I left the Criminal Law team in 2003, there was a restructuring of the

         reporting lines so that the team no longer reported to the head of legal

         services but instead reported to the head of security and investigations. I

         remember thinking at the time that this created a potential conflict of interests,

         as investigators, by their nature, typically wanted cases to be prosecuted, and

         it was the role of prosecutors to apply the tests in the Code for Crown

         Prosecutors as fairly and objectively as possible. I thought the reporting lines

         should have remained entirely separate to avoid even the possibility of any

         internal pressures influencing a decision to prosecute cases.
