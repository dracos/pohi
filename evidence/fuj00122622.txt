I have been employed by Fujitsu Services, Post Office Account, formally ICL.Pathway Ltd
since 20 January 2004 as an Information Technology (IT) Security Analyst responsible for audit
data extractions and IT Security. I have working knowledge of the computer system known as
Horizon, which is a computerised accounting system used by Post Office Ltd. I am authorised
by Fujitsu Services to undertake extractions of audit archived data and to obtain information
regarding system transactions recorded on the Horizon system.


Horizon's documented procedures stipulate how the Horizon System operates, and while I am
not involved with any of the technical aspects of the Horizon System, these documented




At each Post Office there are counter positions that have a, computer terminal, a visual display
unit and a keyboard and printer. This individual system records all completed transactions input
by the counter clerk working at that counter position. Clerks log on to the system by using their
own unique password. The transactions performed by each clerk, and the associated cash
and stock level information, are recorded by the computer system in a stock unit, Once logged
on, all completed transactions performed by the clerk must be recorded and entered on the
computer and are accounted for within the user's allocated stock unit.


The Horizon system provides a. number of daily and weekly records of all completed

transactions input into it. It enables Post Office users to obtain computer summaries for
individual clients of Post Office Limited e.g. Alliance & Leicester. The Horizon system also
enables the clerk to produce a periodic balance of cash and stock on hand combined with the
other transactions performed in that accounting period, known as a trading period.


Where local reports are required these are accessed from a button on the desktop menu. The
user is presented with a parameter driven menu, which enables the report to be customised to
requirements. The report is then populated from transaction data that is held in the local
database and is printed out on the printer. The system also allows for information to be
transferred to the main accounting department at Chesterfield.


The Post Office counter processing functions are provided through a series of counter
applications: the Electronic Point of Sale Service (EPOSS) that enables Postmasters to


Automated Payments Service (APS) which provides support for utility companies and others
who provide incremental in and out payment mechanisms based on the use of cards and other
tokens and the Logistics Feeder Service (LFS) which supports the management of cash and
value stock movements to and from the outlet, principally to minimise cash held overnight in
outlets. The counter desktop service and the office platform service on which it runs provides
various common functions for transaction recording and settlement as well as user access
control and session management.


Information from counter transactions is written into a local database and then replicated
automatically to databases on all other counters within a Post Office outlet. The information is
then forwarded over ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) or other communication
service, to databases on a set of central Correspondence Servers at the Fujitsu Services data
centres. This is undertaken by a messaging transport system within the Transaction
Management Service (TMS). Various systems then transfer information to Central Servers that
control the flow of information to various support services. Details of outlet transactions are
normally sent at least daily via the system. Details are then forwarded daily via a file transfer

An audit of all information handled by the TMS is taken daily by copying all new messages




                                                                                               to
archive media. This creates a record of all completed outlet transaction details including its
origin - outlet and counter, when it happened, who caused it to happen and the outcome. The
TMS journal is maintained at each of the Fujitsu Services Data Centre sites and is created by
securely replicating all completed transaction records that occurred in every Outlet. They
therefore provide the ability to compare the audit track record of the same transaction recorded
in two places to verify that systems were operating correctly. Records of all transactions are
written to audit archive media.


The system clock incorporated into the desktop application on the counter visual display units
is configured to indicate local time. This has been the situation at Preston Road, Branch Code
259020 since 15 November 2000 when the Horizon system was introduced at that particular
Post Office.


The Horizon system records time in GMT and takes no account of Civil Time Displacements,
thus during British Summer Time (BST) (generally the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday
in October), system record timings are shown in GMT - one hour earlier than local time (BST).


When information relating to individual transactions is requested, the data is extracted from the
audit archive media via the Audit Workstations (AWs). Information is presented in exactly the
same way as the data held in the archive although it can be filtered depending upon the type of
information requested. The integrity of data retrieved for audit purposes is guaranteed at all
times from the point of gathering, storage and retrieval to subsequent despatch to the
requester. Controls have been established that provide assurances to Post Office Internal
Audit (P0 IA) that this integrity is maintained.

          Lovelace Lane, Bracknell, Berkshire and Fujitsu Services, Sackville House, Brooks
          Close, Lewes, East Sussex. These sites are both subject to rigorous physical security
          controls appropriate to each location. All AWs are located in a secure room subject to
          proximity pass access within a secured Fujitsu Services site.,
     2. Logical access to the AW and its functionality is managed in accordance with the
          Fujitsu Services, Post Office Account Security Policy and the principles of ISO 17799.
         This includes dedicated Logins, password control and the use of Microsoft Windows NT
         security features.
     3. All extractions are logged on the AW and supported by documented Audit Record
          Queries (ARQs), authorised by nominated persons within Post Office Ltd. This log can
          be scrutinised on the AW.
     4. Extractions are only made by authorised individuals.
     5. Upon receipt of an ARQ from Post Office Ltd they are interpreted by CS Security. The

     6. The required files are identified and marked using the dedicated audit tools.
     7. Checksum seals are calculated for audit data files when they are written to audit
          archive media and re-calculated when the files are retrieved.
     8. To assure the integrity of the audit data while on the audit archive media the checksum
         seal for the file is re-calculated by the Audit Track Sealer and compared to the original
          value calculated when the file was originally written to the audit archive media. The
          result is maintained in a Check Seal Table.
     9. The specific ARQ details are used to obtain the specific data.
     10. The files are copied to the AW where they are checked and converted into the file type
          required by Post Office Ltd.
     11. Windows Events generated by the counters within the branch/timeframe in question are
          checked to ensure the counters were functioning correctly.,
