                       POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




      FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF BELINDA JANE CORTES-MARTIN




I, Belinda Jane Cortes-Martin (previously Crowe), will say as follows —



1. I have made this statement to assist the Post Office Horizon Inquiry (the "Inquiry")

   with the questions set out in the Rule 9 Request addressed to me, dated 23

   February 2024 (the "Request"). The Request contains 62 questions, which I have

   endeavoured to address fully within this statement.




2. I would like to make the Inquiry aware that I have received legal support from

   Ashfords LLP to prepare this Statement.

Background


3. I would like to make the Inquiry aware that I retired in March 2015 and no longer

   have access to my CV. Therefore, in setting out my professional background I am

   relying solely on my memory.




4. I was a Civil Servant for the majority of my working life. I joined the Civil Service

   in, I believe, 1979 and I left in mid-2011. Over these years I worked in a variety of

   roles across different Government departments, but for the final 2/3 years I was

   the Information Director for the Ministry of Justice, dealing generally with matters

   including data protection, freedom of information and records management.




5. After leaving the Civil Service in mid-2011 I set up as an independent consultant,

   undertaking a range of commissions for a variety of clients. The majority of my

   consultancy work related to information security, either working independently or

   as an associate working with other consultancies.




6. To the best of my recollection it was early 2012 when I was invited to carry out

   some work for POL. I was approached by email (followed, I think, with a

   telephone conversation) in late 2011 by the Chair of POL who told me that POL

   may be looking to commission an independent consultant with experience in

   Government to assist POL's work relating to Government proposals to mutualise

   the Post Office. She had been given my name by a mutual acquaintance as

   someone who may be interested in such a commission. She explained that as

   she was the Chair she was not involved in 'hiring' but if I were potentially

                                                                                WITNO9910100




   interested she would pass on my name to those in POL with responsibility for the

   project who may (or may not) contact me. I believe it was at some point in early

   2012 I was invited to a meeting to discuss the project with Susan Crichton, the

   then General Counsel, and Alwen Lyons, the then Company Secretary. I recall at

   the end of the meeting I was invited to submit a proposal for supporting the

   project. My proposal was accepted and I carried out such work as was required,

   initially working within POL's Legal group for General Counsel. Later the work

   moved into Strategy Group. Initially my work on mutualisation was sporadic and I

   was working a few days a month as and when required, whilst also working on

   different projects for other clients. However, as the mutualisation agenda

   progressed, the work with POL took up most of my time.




7. In or around October 2013 I was asked to move and work within POL's Complaint

   Review and Mediation Scheme (hereinafter referred to as the "Scheme"). I can

   see from the documents provided to me that this move was announced in an

   email by POL's then CEO, Paula Vennells, on 8 October 2013 (POL00116179).

   The nature of the work I would be carrying out was set out in her email and I was

   invited to attend a Project Sparrow steering group meeting. I cannot recall

   attending this meeting, however, I presume that I did attend. At that stage my

   role was described in Paula's email as providing secretariat support for the

   Scheme, among other things, but I note from the minutes of the Project Sparrow

   Steering Group meeting on 12 November 2013 (POL00137758), that Paula

   announced I was to become "Programme Director for Sparrow" (the Scheme),

   which I think widened the role.

                                                                                   WITNO9910100




8. As far as I can recall, between October and December 2013 I completed my

   outstanding work on mutualisation, and as that ran down I began my work on the

   Scheme. I accepted a fixed term contract for this new role, to cover the period

   from 1 Jan 2014 to 31 March 2015. Although I started to move over to my work

   on the Scheme towards the end of 2013, I only officially became a POL employee

   from the start of my fixed term contract on 1 Jan 2014.




9. I had agreed that a full time contract (as opposed to a day rate commission as an

   independent consultant) would be appropriate for this role, because I was being

   asked to commit to it on a full time basis for a fixed period.




10. Although my job title was 'Programme Director', it became clear early on that I did

   not have any strategic responsibility or any final authority to make decisions in

   relation to the Scheme, and whilst I managed a small team of colleagues carrying

   out work in relation to the Scheme, I did not supervise or manage any other

   persons in managerial positions. Myself and my team were very much

   coordinators (as opposed to decision makers), carrying out the instructions and

   requirements of the Scheme Working Group (in my capacity as secretariat), the

   Board, its Sub-Committee, and POL General Counsel.




11.1 also provided a support function for the new POL General Counsel, Chris

   Aujard, who was a member of Working Group, in coordinating and assisting him

   in relation to action points arising from the Working Group, as well as the Board

   and Sub-Committee. I deal with my involvement in the Scheme and the Working

                                                                                  WITNO9910100




   Group in further detail under the following subheading of this statement - "Project

   Sparrow, Second Sight and the Mediation Scheme."




12. I left POL to retire when my full time contract ended on 31 March 2015. I had

   always intended to retire at this time and I have not worked since.




The Horizon IT System

13. I confirm that I have considered the following documents provided to me:

     i.     (POL00041564) - Computer Weekly article dated 11 May 2009);

     ii.    (POL00026572) - Ismay Report dated 2 August 2010);

     iii.   (POL00149276) - email from Melanie Corfield to me on 20 October 2014;

     iv. (POL00142406) - email from Mark Underwood to me on 12 November

            2014;

     v.     (POL00151216) - email from Steve Allchorn to me on 16 February 2015)

            and the attachment at (POL00151217).




14. Before starting my work in POL, I do not believe I had any knowledge of the

   Horizon IT System. I most likely knew that POL had a counter system, but I did

   not know how this operated or who the provider of the system was. I think that

   the first time I really became aware of Horizon was when I started my work on the

   Scheme.

                                                                                  WITNO9910100




15. The abbreviation for bugs, errors or defects ("BEDS") was not a term I was aware

   of during my time within POL. As far as I recall, the only information I was aware

   of at the time in relation to possible issues and claims about a potential lack of

   integrity in the Horizon IT system were the matters raised in the Second Sight

   interim report, which was published before my involvement in the Scheme. I

   cannot recall exactly when I read this report, but imagine I would have done so at

   some point after starting my work on the Scheme. I also became aware of such

   issues being raised by Justice for Sub-postmasters Alliance (JFSA) and

   applicants in the Scheme. I was not aware of concerns being raised within POL

   about BEDs or a lack of integrity in the Horizon IT System.




16.1 did not receive any training on the Horizon IT System during my time at POL. I

   was not required to have any knowledge of the system itself - my involvement in

   the Scheme did not include either investigating complaints or checking the work

   of the team in POL that were responsible for investigating the complaints set out

   in applications to the Scheme. I was also not required to consider or interpret any

   Horizon data as part of my role.




17.1 encountered the term 'ARQ data' during my time on the Scheme, but I have no

   recollection of ever knowing exactly what it was and I would not have needed any

   in depth knowledge or understanding of it to assist me in my role of managing the

   Scheme and supporting the Working Group.

                                                                                   WITNO9910100




18. 1 have been asked to address the ability of Fujitsu employees to alter transaction

   data or data in branch accounts without the knowledge or consent of SPMs

   (known as "remote access"). After starting work on the Scheme I became aware

   of a case study in the Second Sight interim report - I believe this was 'spot review

   5', which related to an allegation by a SPM who visited the Fujitsu offices in

   Bracknell and believed he had seen live transaction data being altered by

   employees working in the basement. Having reviewed (POL00151217) I now

   recall this SPM was Mr Michael Rudkin. It is my understanding, as far as I recall,

   that following the publication of their interim report, Second Sight was provided

   with a statement from the employee who was with Mr Rudkin during his visit to

   Bracknell, to the effect that what Mr Rudkin observed during his visit was a test

   environment and not connected to live data.




19.1 do remember Second Sight asking POL for email data from 2008 relating to

   matters concerning Spot Review 5. Having read (POL00151217), and from my

   recollection from my time working on the Scheme I think that this request was the

   subject of a number of exchanges between Second Sight and POL, and was

   discussed in detail in two meetings in 2015. 1 do not recall the specifics of these

   meetings, but having now reviewed the documents provided to me, I can see that

   the full positions of Second Sight and POL on this matter are found in the minutes

   of those meeting at (POL00022296) and (POL00063428).




20. The issue of `remote access' was was raised by Second Sight on a number of

   occasions during my time on the Scheme, but my understanding was that POL

   considered that the matter had been addressed in its response to Spot Review 5

                                    Page 70f68
                                                                                    WITNO9910100
                                                                                  WITNO9910100




   and, as far as I was aware, POL and Fujitsu maintained the position that

   transaction data could not be changed remotely without the knowledge of an

   SPM.




21.1 did have a conversation with someone in Fujitsu about `remote access' in early

   2015. 1 cannot remember who the call was with, but I believe the conversation

   was prompted by a query raised by the CEO in response to briefing she had

   been provided with relating to her appearance before the BIS Select Committee

   in February 2015. I recall being told by the Fujitsu employee that there was a

   provision to deal with a major incident or emergency whereby a senior person at

   Fujitsu could access the Horizon IT system to rectify a major problem, however,

   this provision was subject to rigorous authorisation and audit arrangements and

   as far as I recall, he told me that to his knowledge this provision had never been

   used. He explained that POL would be involved if it were to be used, and whilst

   the function existed, it did not alter the basic proposition that Fujitsu could not

   remotely alter transaction data without the knowledge of the SPM. I would like to

   highlight that this may not have been the specific wording used by the Fujitsu

   employee during the call, but it was wording to this effect.




22.As I did not recall knowing about this provision, I reported back to POL General

   Counsel. He confirmed that it was normal for every major IT system to have what

   I believe he referred to as a 'superuser facility'. Again, these may not have been

   the exact words he used, but it was wording to this effect.

                                                                                    WITNO9910100




23. 1 can see from (POL00149276) that a few months prior to my phone call with

   Fujitsu in early 2015, Melanie Corfield forwarded myself, Patrick Bourke and Tom

   Wechsler an email from Andrew Parsons (an external lawyer at Bond Dickinson),

   illustrating the following had been confirmed by Fujitsu — "The system has been

   designed to prevent any access, either remote or direct, that would allow

   individual branch transactions to be altered. Fujitsu has controlled access to the

   Horizon system for software updates and maintenance purposes_ This is of

   course strictly controlled with security processes in place, but could not, in any

   event, be used to alter individual branch transactions — there is no facility within

   the system to do this." This would have been my understanding, however, I note

   that Andrew comments that an issue had been identified relating to injecting

   transaction data. I do not recall this email. I am unsure if I simply missed it, or

   whether I believed it was a technical matter that lawyers were `getting to the

   bottom of' as Andrew states and I would be informed if I was required to take any

   action, so I did not engage with it further.




24. 1 recall that, as a result of my conversation with Fujitsu in February 2015, and the

   fact that the subject of `remote access' continued to crop up regularly, I

   suggested to my team that it would be worth commissioning a piece of work to

   look at how the superuser operation in the Horizon IT system worked. My

   concern was that there seemed to be no common understanding of the term

   `remote access', so a one size fits all answer may not be appropriate. Rather, a

   wider and more sophisticated response to the issue of `remote access' was

   required. Unfortunately, I do not know if such work was ever commissioned after I

   left POL.

                                                                                  WITNO9910100




25. 1 would like to stress that I was never concerned that Fujitsu might be adjusting

   transaction data without the knowledge of SPMs. My understanding was,

   throughout my time working on the Scheme, that transaction data could not be

   altered without the knowledge of the SPM. I believed, from what I had been told,

   and with my limited technical knowledge, that if any intervention was necessary,

   for whatever reason, any alteration would have to be seen and accepted by the

   SPM (e.g. as a transaction correction).




26.1 do not recall if I ever read the May 2009 Computer Weekly article at

   (POL00041564). This was published well before my time in POL, and I do not

   recall ever being involved in any internal discussions about it. I did become aware

   that Computer Weekly had written articles about Horizon and I would have read

   any which were published while I was working on the Scheme.




27. 1 have no recollection of reading or knowing about the Ismay Report dated 2

   August 2010 at (POL00026572). I believe the first time I had heard of this report

   was during the course of watching other evidence given at the Inquiry. I do not

   know whether it was ever used in POL's response to any complaints made in

   applications to the Scheme as I not involved in the investigation side. It was not

   my role to consider the investigation reports and I lacked the knowledge and

   expertise to do so.

29. 1 have been asked to provide an account of my involvement in POL's response to

   the `emerging scandal', including the nature and extent of my involvement in

   Project Sparrow, Second Sight's investigation, the Scheme and the Scheme's

   Working Group. I would like to stress to the Inquiry that during my time within

   POL, these matters were not viewed as an 'emerging scandal.' POL's position in

   relation to Second Sight's interim report was that the report stated that no

   evidence of systemic problems with the Horizon software had been found and, as

   far as I understood, POL continued to have confidence that Horizon was working

   as it should. However, POL noted that improvements could be made in the

   training and support processes provided to SPMs. In response to the report POL

   made a number of commitments, one of which was to create the Scheme.

   Second Sight's original investigation was completed before my involvement with

   the Scheme and I had understood that after the creation of the Scheme, Second

   Sight's role changed to one of reviewing the POL investigation reports into the

   complaints set out in the individual applications to the Scheme.

                                                                                   WITNO9910100




30.In terms of Project Sparrow, I am not aware of the background to its set up, as

   this was before my involvement in the Scheme. I do not recall if I was ever to►d its

   original remit.




31- Having looked at the documents provided to me with the Request, I now recall

   that there was a steering group chaired by Paula Vennells, overseeing the work

   of Project Sparrow. It appears that I attended at least two steering group

   meetings prior the official start date for my role on the Scheme. The notes of

   these meetings set out early expectations for the role, although I can see from my

   review of the documents that the reality over time differed somewhat from the

   early expectations.




32. To the best of my recollection, and having reviewed the documents, there were

   two main strands of what was called Project Sparrow which were, until I became

   involved, led by Angela Van den Bogerd — (1) the Complaint Review and

   Mediation Scheme and (2) the Business Improvements Programme, which

   addressed issues arising out of complaints within the Scheme. At the point that I

   became involved, these two strands were separated and handled separately. I

   became responsible for the Scheme and Angela continued to lead the Business

   Improvement Programme.




33. Nevertheless, whilst investigations into complaints contained in Scheme

   applications technically fell within the Scheme, I was not responsible for the

   substance of those investigations. Angela was responsible for this work because


                                   Page 17 of 68
                                                                                    WITNO9910100
                                                                                  WITNO9910100




   of her particular expertise and experience in Horizon and the way the system

   worked, and she managed the investigation team. My involvement in the

   investigations was limited to chasing the progress of those investigations, along

   with progress of Second Sight's reviews of the investigations in order to

   effectively manage the progress of applications within the Scheme.




34.After this split the term "Project Sparrow" was continued to be used as a short-

   hand and for the Scheme, however, Project Sparrow effectively just became the

   Scheme.




35. 1 have been asked to explain why POL's Board created a formal Sub-Committee

   to oversee Project Sparrow. I do not know why the Board did this. As far as I can

   recall, I was simply told it was going to do so and I would not have expected to be

   consulted on this.




36. In terms of the process by which I was appointed as Programme Director of the

   Scheme, having now reviewed (POL00116719) I assume that I had a

   conversation with Paula Vennells (or someone on her behalf) prior to being

   invited to a steering group meeting for Project Sparrow. I do not remember this

   conversation, or the steering group meeting. Until that point I knew virtually

   nothing about the work of Second Sight and I do not think I had heard of the

   Scheme.

                                                                                 WITNO9910100




37. My primary role was to provide secretariat support for the Chair and the Working

   Group overseeing the Mediation Scheme and managing the Scheme on a day to

   day basis in line with the requirements of the Working Group and POL. Although

   there were less than 150 cases in the Scheme, the whole process of managing

   cases through the Scheme was manual, and therefore administratively and

   resource intensive. For example, the movement of cases was tracked using a

   spreadsheet and every time a case moved to the next stage of the process it had

   to be recorded manually. I and my team tracked the movement of cases,

   progress chased if a deadline for a stage to be completed was approaching, sent

   the necessary documentation to applicants and their advisors in line with the

   instructions of the Chair and the Working Group, set up payment authorisations

   and arrangements to check and pay invoices and complete the budgetary

   requirements set by POL. Once cases completed their investigation and review

   stages we were responsible for liaising with all relevant parties, including CEDR,

   to arrange the mediation meetings themselves.




38. We also organised the Working Group meetings and completed the minutes and

   paperwork for the meetings. I believe these meetings were held weekly as the

   Scheme progressed in the form of, a full face to face meeting every month to

   discuss substantive issues and a telecon each week (if required) for case

   progression and urgent business. If actions required chasing, I would do this and

   would provide updates to the Working Group as requested. I also supported the

   Chair of the Working Group by dealing with correspondence relating to the

   Scheme by preparing draft letters for his consideration either for applicants,

   advisors or external stakeholders raising questions about the Scheme.

39. 1 also assisted in making sure that POL completed its action points from the

   Working Group meetings. To this end I often commissioned and co-ordinated

   briefings for POL General Counsel to be able to respond to requests for

   information arising from those meetings.




40. My work as Programme Director of the Scheme also involved gathering and

   providing information and advice when requested by POL's Board and Sub-

   Committee for consideration by POL General Counsel before being submitted to

   the Board.




41- In terms of my involvement with Second Sight, I managed the day to day

   relationship with them, however, this did not start until after the publication of their

   2013 interim report and my involvement in the Scheme. I negotiated resources

   with them, paid their invoices and was generally their main point of contact within

   POL for requests for information.




42.To the best of my recollection the scope of my role as Programme Director

   developed over time. When I signed my full time contract for the role, the General

   Counsel, as my line manager, was required to agree work objectives with me. I

   do not have a copy of those objectives and I cannot remember the detail of them

   but as far as I can recall those objectives were broadly to provide secretariat

   support for the Scheme and Working Group, manage the day to day relationship

   with Second Sight and take any necessary actions as required by the Board and


                                     Page 20 of 68

                                                                                  WITNO9910100




   POL in relation to the Scheme. I think the nature or description of the role was an

   emerging picture and it evolved as the Scheme developed. The Scheme and the

   role was new and it was it was left to me and POL General Counsel to develop it

   in line with the Working Group's and Board's requirements.




43. Within POL I imagine my role would have likely been referred to as Mediation

   Scheme Programme Director, or secretariat support to the Scheme Working

   Group. Having reviewed the papers, it may also have been referred to as Project

   Sparrow Programme Director, however, I would not have called myself this as I

   do not think the term `Project Sparrow' was understood by anyone other than

   Board and ExCo members and a few people closely connected with the work.




44.As mentioned earlier in this statement, in my role I had a small team assisting me

   with the operation of the Scheme. We were located in POL's Legal group and, as

   far as I recall, my team comprised 7 people at its largest (although there were

   several personnel changes throughout the Scheme). My line manager was Chris

   Aujard (General Counsel to POL and member of the Working Group). I also

   reported to the Board and its Sub-Committee, through POL's General Counsel,

   who were overseeing the Scheme. As my role was not permanent and was

   specific to the Scheme, I do not think it was otherwise part of POL's main or

   overarching governance structure.




45. With the advice of PA consulting, who came in to assist with the establishment of

   the Scheme when I started my role, we replaced the CEO chaired steering group


                                   Page 21 of 68
                                                                                   WITNO9910100
                                                                                 WITNO9910100




   with a Programme Board, chaired by POL General Counsel, to oversee the

   Scheme from within POL. However, it soon became clear that this was not a

   `Programme' in the sense that it was not delivering a major change programme,

   and although the Programme Board appears to have met a few times in early

   2014, it was soon disbanded. The POL Board established a Sub-Committee to

   oversee the Scheme instead and it appears that a sub group of ExCo was also

   established. I have no recollection of the ExCo group and do not recall attending

   any meetings.




46. 1 kept my work for POL and my work for the Working Group separate and I never

   felt conflicted in my role as Programme Director for the Scheme and secretariat

   for the Working Group. For example if the Chair had made a ruling on an

   application within the Scheme and asked me to send it simultaneously to POL

   and JFSA to ensure both parties received the information at the same time, I

   would do that, and at no time did POL expect me to treat it favourably in relation

   to the Scheme. There were also occasions when Second Sight raised matters

   with me and I added them to the agenda for the Working Group meeting so that if

   POL was going to, for example, deny requests for information from Second Sight,

   it would have to do so on the record and with the knowledge and opinion of the

   Working Group's Chair. The Inquiry should note that POL was represented by

   two members on the Working Group, POL General Counsel (Chris Aujard, who

   was also my line manager) as the senior manager in POL responsible for the

   Scheme and Angela Van Den Bogerd as the leader of the complaints

   investigation team. It was for those members, particularly POL General Counsel,

   that I would commission and co-ordinate briefings from experts within POL so


                                   Page 22 of 68
                                                                                     WITNO9910100
                                                                                   WITNO9910100




   that they, as members of the Working Group, could respond to requests from the

   Working Group.




47.1 have been asked if I informed members of the Working Group, JFSA or other

   third parties about my position on `Project Sparrow.' I am not sure that any project

   names were referred to outside of POL. The Working Group members knew that I

   worked for POL and, as far as I am aware, that POL General Counsel was my

   line manager, but I do not remember whether or how I described my exact role to

   the Working Group. As far as I recall I always made it clear when speaking to a

   member of the Working Group if I were speaking for POL (which I sometimes did

   to pass on messages or information from POL) or as Secretariat to the Working

   Group.




48_ In relation to Second Sight's work on the Scheme I believe that POL's Board was

   responsible for deciding the ambit of Second Sight's investigation and amending

   or terminating Second Sight's contract with POL.




49. 1 believe that Chris Aujard (and later Jane MacLeod) as General Counsel was

   responsible for deciding the documents or information to be provided to Second

   Sight.




50. 1 had no authority to make decisions relating to the matters in paragraphs 48 and

   49 above. Rather, I would offer assistance and opinion on such matters if I felt

   necessary or was asked to do so. I can recall one example of this in relation to

                                   Page 23 of 68
                                                                                      WITNO9910100
                                                                                    WITNO9910100




   the matter of Second Sight's contract with POL. There was an ongoing debate

   between Second Sight and POL in that Second Sight believed it had a role

   beyond the individual applications in the Scheme and POL disagreed. My

   understanding was that following the publication of the Second Sight interim

   report of 2013 and the creation of the Scheme, the role of Second Sight changed

   to a role of reviewing POL's investigations on Scheme applications. This change

   pre-dated my involvement in the Scheme and I had no input into it. I recall that at

   some point - I do not recall when - it became clear that Second Sight disagreed

   with this later definition of its role and there were several attempts to resolve the

   matter, but I do not think any totally succeeded. I had a number of conversations

   with Second Sight directors about this and I tried to resolve the issue through

   suggesting a letter of engagement, which it appeared Second Sight had not had.

   However, I eventually had to refer this issue to POL General Counsel I was

   unable to resolve it and it was outside of my level of authority to attempt to force

   the matter. As stated above, I am not sure that the matter was ever totally

   resolved.




51. In terms of briefings, I provided these as and when requested or required by the

   Board (or Sub-Committee), POL General Counsel or other senior managers. I

   included in briefings any information either requested or which I felt may be

   relevant. Any technical or legal input for such briefings was obtained from either

   lawyers, Angela Van Den Bogerd or relevant subject experts within POL, such as

   IT or Comms. I cannot specifically recall including information regarding BEDS in

   any briefings as, as far as I am aware, the matter never arose. Had it done so

   terms of `remote access', I have dealt with my recollection of passing on

   information about this is in paragraphs 18-25 above. As far as I recall POL's

   position, or at least my understanding of it, in relation to BEDs (although as

   stated earlier in this statement, is not an abbreviation I ever recall hearing at the

   time) and remote access didn't change throughout the period I worked in POL.




52.1 liaised with the Shareholder Executive ("ShEx") on routine matters of

   Parliamentary Questions and correspondence and would also brief ShEx if

   requested by the Board_ ShEx was also represented on the Board and Sub-

   Committee and therefore as far as I am aware had access to all Board papers on

   the Scheme. I also very likely provided briefings for POL senior managers if they

   were meeting Government to discuss the Scheme. As ever, my briefing would

   have pulled together input from the relevant subject experts within POL Any

   technical information relating to Horizon, or any legal information relating to

   prosecutions that the subject experts provided, would have been inserted into the

   briefing by me (or someone on my team). The only information included in any

   briefing that was not either provided by or cleared by a subject expert would be

   facts and figures relating to the progress of applications in the Scheme. To the

   best of my recollection I only directly briefed a Minister once — this was Jo

   Swinson in advance of a Westminster Hall debate. The debate was about the

   Scheme, so my role in the Scheme meant I was best placed to provide the brief.




53. 1 do not know if any senior managers and / or directors of POL were concerned

   about personal liability for malicious prosecution. If it were ever discussed in my

   presence, I have no recollection of it.

54. From documents provided to me, I can see that the setting up of the Scheme and

   the Working Group was announced in August 2013. This pre dates my

   involvement in the Scheme and I was not privy to any discussions about this.

   The press release announcing the introduction of the Scheme on 26 August 2013

   shows that it was established following the publication of Second Sight's report

   into the Horizon IT system, published in July 2013. The press release said that

   Second Sight's report stated that so far no evidence of systemic problems with

   the Horizon software had been found. However, it noted that improvements could

   be made in the training and support processes provided to SPMs. In response to

   the report POL made a number of commitments, one of which was to create the

   Scheme.




55.1 can see references to settlement strategies within the documents provided to

   me, for example (POL00137758) shows that a settlement policy was developed

   to be discussed by ExCo, but I now have no recollection of the policy or any

   discussions about it. However, once the Scheme was underway and mediations

   had started, as far as I can recall the general strategy was to resolve and settle a

   complaint if at all possible, provided the agreed outcome was not unreasonable

   or totally disproportionate. As far as I can recall, before every mediation there

   were discussions between lawyers, Angela Van Den Bogerd, the POL mediator

   and someone from my team to ascertain a broad understanding as to what a

   possible mediation outcome might be. This was to try to ensure consistency, as

   the mediator may not have been directly involved in the investigation process for

   the actual complaint being mediated. However, it was accepted and understood

                                                                                  WITNO9910100




   that the mediator needed to have flexibility to respond on the on the basis of what

   arose during mediation discussions. In order to ensure POL avoided delaying a

   mediation meeting because of staff unavailability, it used a number of different

   personnel as mediators.




56. 1 have considered the following from my email at 06:43 on 28 November 2013 at

   (POL00146934): "On the point about.. .the system, the fact is that no such

   problems have been found... the Scheme is not designed to identify such

   problems, it is to deal with complaints". As mentioned above, I do not believe I

   was aware of the term BEDs at the time, but in any event the Scheme was not

   set up to investigate potential issues with the Horizon IT System. Rather, the

   Scheme was designed to give SPMs an opportunity to make a complaint which

   would be investigated. As mentioned in paragraph 29 of this statement, this was

   one of the commitments made by POL to improve the support provided to SMPs,

   following the publication of Second Sight's interim report.




57. The contents of the email exchange at (POL00146934) suggests to me that my

   understanding of the Scheme's purpose represents the view held within POL

   generally, and this had been the view since before I became involved in the

   Scheme. However, I also understood that POL was of the view that during the

   course of investigating and reviewing the individual complaints in the Scheme, it

   was, of course, possible that a systemic problem with Horizon could be identified

   and that was a matter which would have to be addressed. Nevertheless, the main

   aim of the Scheme was to address complaints.

58. 1 have been asked if I at all considered there to be a difference between what

   POL stated publicly about the Mediation Scheme compared to what was

   discussed internally. I do not recall thinking that there was a difference, however,

   I do think that it became clear once the Scheme got underway that POL's view of

   Second Sight's role and how the Scheme would work differed from others' views,

   such as JFSA and Second Sight. I cannot account for the reason for this as I was

   not involved in the initial set-up of the Scheme. I think perhaps a general desire to

   get the Scheme up and running quickly before thrashing out all the necessary

   detail prior to the Scheme starting and/or being announced may have been a

   contributory factor. An example of this would be not having agreed clear terms of

   engagement with Second Sight and, defining its role in relation to the Scheme

   from the outset. It also appears to be the case from the various comments set out

   in (POL00146939), as discussed in the preceding paragraph of that document,

   that there was a difference of opinion between JFSA and POL about the aim of

   the Scheme. Having said that, I do not recall feeling that the difference was

   significant at the time.




59.1 am unable to explain the background to Andrew Parsons' suggestion within

   (POL00123004) that "Work is continuing on managing SS out of the Scheme. In

   general, SS' role is gradually being reduced until they can be removed entirely.

   This work has already begun". I only became involved in the Scheme in October

   2013, shortly before this email from Andrew on 21 October 2013, and I do not

   recall this email at all. Clearly Second Sight remained involved in the Scheme for

   some 18 months after this email by Andrew Parsons (which was the period I was

   working on the Scheme), but it is clear from the documents I have been asked to

   review that the work of Second Sight and their continued involvement in the

   Scheme was a subject discussed regularly by the Board and the Sub-Committee.




60. 1 do not know the reasons for the above approach in respect of Second Sight's

   continued involvement in the Scheme. I do recall from early on in my involvement

   in the Scheme that POL was concerned about impartiality. I believe that this was

   the impression I came away with when attending my first steering group meeting

   on Project Sparrow. I also have a very vague recollection from many months

   before my involvement in the Scheme (perhaps in late 2012 or early 2013) of

   Susan Crichton asking me whether I had any contacts who were forensic

   accountants. My recollection (although it may not be entirely accurate as I was

   not really aware of the Second Sight work at this time) was that POL was

   concerned about lack of progress by Second Sight, but I do not know whether

   this concern went beyond Susan Crichton. I think that I may have I passed on

   some contact details, but I do not think this was followed up.




61. From my recollection, I believe that POL wanted to ensure that it could draw a

   line under the concerns about Horizon at the end of the Scheme, once the

   applications had all been investigated, mediated (where the parties agreed to

   mediation) and resolved where possible. I believe the aim of this was to ensure

   that the role of the Working Group and Second Sight did not continue to become

   part of any permanent arrangement for investigating new complaints as they

   arose.




62. 1 do recall that the Board (through the Sub-Committee while it existed) were

   keeping the Scheme under review. I can also see from the documents provided,

   for example (POL00137758), that ExCo were also involved in decisions relating

   to the Scheme. I do not know if there were any other considerations or

   discussions by POL senior management about amending the nature of the

   Scheme or the Working Group.




63. Those people who were involved in discussions relating to any review of the

   Scheme and strategies around the same would have been Board and Sub-

   Committee members, ExCo, Angela Van Den Bogerd, lawyers, myself and others

   in my team who were involved in preparation of options. ShEx was also

   represented on the Board and the Subcommittee, so they would have been

   aware of such information. Unfortunately I cannot recall the specific discussions,

   but I see from minutes of various meetings I have been provided with they

   focussed upon whether the Scheme was effective in terms of achieving its aims

   in terms of cost and timeframe expectations. I do not know if there was a

   difference of views on these issues. I would imagine that any difference that

   existed between Board or ExCo members would not have been discussed in front

   of me.

64.1 think one of the reasons as to why the Scheme was kept under review was due

   to the fact that POL had set up the Scheme at considerable cost and before

   doing so Second Sight had presented findings in its interim report that there was

   no evidence of systemic problems with Horizon at that stage of the Second Sight

   investigation. For these reasons it seemed reasonable to me, and indeed good

   practice, that POL would keep the Scheme under review, to know whether or not

   it was working as originally intended, and to consider other options if they were

   not happy with how it was working.




65.1 have been asked to describe my recollection of the board meeting on 26

   February 2014. Unfortunately I do not have any specific recollection of this

   meeting and I therefore defer entirely to the minutes of that meeting at

   (POL00302500)_     Following a review of the minutes, I can see that whilst I

   attended that part of the meeting which dealt with the Scheme I did not appear to

   play an active part in the meeting.




66. 1 prepared the paper for the meeting (see POL00027452). As far as I can recall,

   all papers prepared for Board meetings were prepared on behalf of an ExCo

   member - in my case this would have been POL General Counsel. I believe we

   would have discussed the potential contents of the report and I would have pulled

   it together with input from other relevant people for approval before being

   submitted to the Board. I believe that the Board was presented with a full and

   accurate picture of (a) the current status of the Mediation Scheme and (b) the

   future plans for the Mediation Scheme and / or Second Sight during this Board

   meeting. As is noted in the meeting minutes under the sub heading `INITIAL

   COMPLAINT REVIEW AND MEDIATION SCHEME', the Board seems to have

   requested a paper setting out the worst case scenario and this is the commission

   I, and POL General Counsel, appear to have fulfilled.




67. Whilst I have very little recollection of this, I can see from the papers that I had

   some involvement in commissioning a piece of work by Linklaters, to provide

   legal advice to the Board in relation to Horizon/the Scheme. I would not have

   reviewed this advice in any particular detail, so I do not recall having any specific

   view on it. I imagine the decision to get this advice would have come from a

   Board discussion and I would have simply been assisting POL General Counsel

   in in obtaining it. I do not recall what actions POL took as a result of such advice.




68. In terms of the documents that POL allowed Second Sight to access, and as far

   as I can recall, it was my initial understanding that following a discussion at a

   Working Group meeting, Second Sight were provided access to all relevant legal

   files, and I was in involved in making sure that they were provided with such files

   as they requested. However, I recall that it later transpired that they also wanted

   access to legal advice which POL considered to be legally privileged. I do not

   know what this specific advice was. As far as I recall I only became aware in

   early 2015 of the fact that Second Sight wanted access to privileged legal advice.

   Apart from the POL investigation reports on the applications within the Scheme, I

   have no recollection of any other investigation reports Second Sight wanted

   access to.

69.As alluded to above, I believe that there was a difference in opinion between

   Second Sight and POL in terms of the scope of Second Sight's work in relation to

   the Scheme, in so far as POL thought that Second Sight's role was limited to

   reviewing POL investigation reports on applications within the Scheme, but

   Second Sight seemed to think it had a wider role, although I do not reca►l that this

   wider role was ever fully articulated. Apart from the privileged information

   contained in the legal files, I think that Second Sight was provided with the

   information and the documents it requested and needed to fulfil its role in relation

   to the Scheme. However, there was clearly a disagreement about the scope of

   Second Sight's work and their access to wider information relating to that.

   Nevertheless, the only issue I can specifically recall in connection to this is the

   issue of Second Sight's access to email data relating to the Spot Review 5, which

   I have dealt with earlier in this statement.




70. 1 have been asked to what extent I agreed with Mark Davies' point - "I have been

   thinking about the question we will get about why we won't let SS look at

   everything - too which the obvious answer is there is no evidence of a problem"

   (POL00150869). I cannot recall this email or whether I had any view on it. If I had

   to speculate on how I may have approached this email, I believe I would have

   been considering whether or not, or how, the provision of all information

   requested by Second Sight would have assisted individual applicants in the

   Scheme.

71. 1 do not know the eventual outcome in respect of POL's position on retaining

   Horizon data held by Fujitsu beyond the normal seven year retention period once

   the Scheme had ended. However, my position at page 7 of (POL00108521) that

   a "proper retention policy exists for a purpose and I do not think we can put a

   blanket ban on destruction" needs to be read in context of the rest of that email

   chain. As a general proposition I do think that a retention policy exists for a

   reason, for example a legal reason related to Data Protection, and therefore I

   would not think it appropriate to put a blanket ban on the destruction of data and

   documents, as doing so could risk breaching legal requirements. However, when

   reading the rest of that email chain at (POL00108521), it is clear that my

   suggestion in these specific circumstances was for POL to tell Fujitsu to

   immediately stop destroying data at the end of the seven year retention period as

   a temporary measure to ensure that no data was destroyed that may be needed

   to investigate Scheme applications, and then come to a considered view about

   retention of data going forward which could be agreed with Fujitsu. I escalated

   the matter to the CIO to ensure that data destruction at Fujitsu was halted as a

   matter of urgency.




72. 1 do not recall the Board meeting on 21 May 2014, but I have reviewed the

   minutes of such meeting at (POL00021525). I do not know what Alwen Lyons

   meant when she wrote "It's a bit smoke and mirrors but here are the minutes,

   comments asap please" at (POL00148420). From my review of the minutes, it

   seems that subject to the work of Deloitte, there remained at Board level an

   appetite for amending the Scheme.

73.1 believe the meeting with Second Sight on 11 August 2014 at (POL00129437)

   probably came about as a result of an action point raised in a previous Working

   Group meeting. This action would have likely related to POL's comments on

   Second Sight's draft report of August 2014. Part of my role was to try and ensure

   that whatever POL decided it wanted to do, it did so in a way that was

   transparent and properly documented. This would have included making sure

   that if there was an action point raised by the Working Group, such action point

   was addressed. Exactly how it was addressed was a matter for POL. In relation

   to the August 2014 Report my main interest would have been the Scheme and

   trying to make sure the applicants within it were assisted by any reports delivered

   by Second Sight. It would not have been helpful for an applicant to attend

   mediation and raise an issue citing a Second Sight report, for a POL

   representative to then tell the applicant that they disagree with the report as it

   goes beyond the scope of Second Sight's expertise or scope of work.




74. 1 did not disagree with the position taken by POL in the meeting on 11 August,

   particularly in that I agreed with Paragraph 22 of the minutes that it could not be

   right for Second Sight to undertake work on instructions from other people (e.g.

   MPs) and require POL to fund this without prior agreement. I would have thought

   it reasonable that any additional work commissioned from Second Sight should

   be discussed with POL first to ensure it either fell within the scope of their work,

   or was generally accepted as new work to be undertaken and funded.

75. 1 did not draft the briefing at (POL00149393) and I cannot recall whether I

   contributed to it. I imagine it would have been compiled with the input from

   various people within POL, and presumably it would have been agreed with

   POL's General Counsel.




76. 1 have been asked in particular to what extent I agreed with the following passage

   of the briefing at (POL00149393): "To start from a contrary position, whereby PO

   must prove the system's reliability, goes against both common sense and

   established practice. Bluntly, it is not PO's job to prove that Horizon did not cause

   the losses incurred by Applicants to the Scheme, but for Applicants to provide

   evidence that it did". This appears to me to be a legal position and I imagine it

   was drafted by a lawyer, but I cannot be certain. I do not recall if I held any

   particular view in relation to this.




77. 1 also find it difficult to say now the extent to which I agreed or disagreed with the

   commentary on Second Sight's reports within the briefing at (POL00149393).

   POL's assessment of the reports would not have been a matter for me and I

   seldom, if ever, read POL's investigation reports on Scheme applications, nor

   Second Sight's review of those reports. However, there was certainly an

   expectation at the outset by POL (and I believe also the Working Group Chair,

   although I cannot recall this for certain) that Second Sight would give a

   recommendation on whether mediation was appropriate in the cases that they

   reviewed. As far as I recall there was an early case in the Scheme where Second

   Sight did not recommend mediation, following their review of POL's investigation.

   However, Second Sight later announced that they would recommend mediation

   in all cases going forward on the basis, as far as I recall, of a query from JFSA. I

   think the Working Group Chair asked Second Sight to reconsider this position,

   but they declined. I would like to emphasise to the Inquiry that I do not remember

   the exact detail of any discussions had in relation to this and due to the amount of

   time that has passed, it is possible that my recollection may be inaccurate.

79. It would not have been my decision on how to respond to the substantive issues

   raised by applicants in the Scheme or by Second Sight, as that was a matter for

   the relevant subject experts, the POL team investigating Scheme applications

   and lawyers. Although substantive issues did cross my desk on occasion, the

   extent of my involvement would have been to attempt to review them, raise what I

   thought might be relevant questions and refer to the relevant subject experts to

   provide Angela Van Den Bogerd, POL General Counsel and any other person

   who I thought needed to be aware with the answers or further information they

                                                                                     WITNO9910100




   needed to respond to such issues. It was very much a case of trying to co-

   ordinate activity to make sure the right people were involved so that matters were

   resolved.




80.1 believe that I became aware of the Helen Rose report at some point in 2014,

   although I do not recall exactly when. Following my review of the report and the

   email correspondence around this matter, I do not think that I appreciated at the

   time the extent to which the contents of it may have been important to those

   SPMs who had been convicted of theft, a fraud offence or false accounting on the

   basis of data generated by the Horizon IT System.




81. Having looked at the email chain at (POL00148049), it seems that the Helen

   Rose report was a matter that arose in the Working Group and I did raise

   questions about it. However, on review of my em ails in this chain, it is clear that I

   was trying to coordinate answers to potential questions raised by the report by

   trying to make relevant people aware of the contents of the report. In particular, I

   would want to ensure that Angela Van Den Bogerd and POL General Counsel

   were in possession of all the facts to deal with the issue at the Working Group,

   and that lawyers were briefing POL General Counsel in relation to any related

   disclosure issues. I would imagine I would have drafted my latest email in this

   chain following a conversation with Rodric Williams from Legal and Andrew

   Parsons. I do not recall what subsequently happened in relation to this matter at

   the Working Group.

                                                                                    WITNO9910100




82. 1 would like to stress to the Inquiry that I was not involved in the process of

   disclosure in relation to criminal prosecutions as this fell entirely outside of my

   responsibility, expertise and competence. I was aware that a process had been

   established (I believe prior to my involvement with the Scheme), to ensure that

   POL fulfilled its disclosure obligations. My only involvement was that the cost of

   the disclosure exercise was met by the Scheme budget. Otherwise, apart from

   getting input from lawyers on the subject (if needed) when pulling together

   briefings, I was not involved at all in the exercise.




83. 1 note that I am also copied in to an email from Andrew Parsons on 17 June

   2014, which refers to the Helen Rose report (P0L00020634). 1 do not recall this

   email and I believe I would have been copied in for information purposes only. I

   do not know if the advice set out by Mr Parsons was followed - "try to down play

   the importance of the HR report in any POL Investigation Reports. We

   recommend minimalizing or ignoring entirely the HR Report when responding to

   CQRs". I believe it is likely that I would have read this email, but not personally

   taken any further action in relation to it. I was not involved in the POL

   investigation reports and having looked at the subject experts on the copy list of

   this email, I believe I would have considered that this was a matter for them.




84.1 have been asked about my involvement in POL's response to Second Sight on

   the allegation that there were unexplained gains in the POL suspense account as

   a result of SPMs settling false discrepancies. I would not have got involved in the

   specific detail or technicalities related to POL suspense accounts as it was a

                                                                                   WITNO9910100




   subject outside of my area of knowledge and expertise and a matter for the

   subject experts such as POL Finance. I think this issue was an action point

   arising out of a Working Group meeting. As alluded to earlier in this statement, I

   was responsible for coordinating matters to ensure that action points raised by

   the Working Group were addressed and completed by POL. To the best of my

   recollection, I believe I commissioned some work in relation to this issue on

   behalf of POL, which culminated in a meeting between Second Sight and POL's

   CFO to answer Second Sight's outstanding questions. I helped to organise this

   meeting, but I would not have attended the meeting or been involved in the detail

   of the discussions.




85. 1 have also been asked various questions that relate to Second Sight's part 2

   report. As far as I can recall, Second Sight had issued an interim report in 2013

   (prior to my involvement in the Scheme) and then what I thought was called the

   part 2 briefing report in April 2015 (after I had retired from POL). However, having

   now reviewed the Rule 9 disclosure I can see that there was also a "thematic

   report" in August 2014, also called the part two report. From the documents I

   have read this report was not meant for publication but was produced as a

   briefing report for Scheme applicants. The documents show that I would have

   been involved in discussions on POL's strategy in responding to the August 2014

   report as it was relevant to the Scheme and I can see from the email at

   (POL00006558) that I forwarded a document to Andrew Pheasant and others

   which appears to be POL's response to such report, in which I suggested some

   minor track changes. This document is found at (POL00006559)_ I can see that

   my suggestions were only minor formatting changes or slight re-wording of

                                   Page 41 of 68

                                                                                 WITNO9910100




   sentences to aid understanding. I also note that I offered to draft a letter from

   Angela Van Den Bogerd to accompany the amended response when sending it

   off, however, I believe this letter would have simply been a cover letter, and my

   offer to draft it was consistent with that part of my role which saw me co-

   ordinating activity to support POL members of the Working Group.




86. The content of my email to Alwen Lyons on 22 August 2014 at (POL00148870)

   relates to Second Sight's "thematic report" of August 2014, and would have been

   an amalgam of input from others which I pulled together. I think that much of this

   email's content would have been drawn from POL comments already passed to

   Second Sight on the draft report, for example, Rodric Williams' letter, addressed

   to Second Sight and dated 14 August 2014 (POL00022216).




87.1 assume that I sent my email to Alwen Lyons because Second Sight's August

   2014 report concerned matters relating to the Scheme which may become public,

   and I had been asked to alert the Board of this, presumably on the basis that it

   would be inappropriate for Board members to read about the report in the media

   without having been briefed about it




88.1 would have been satisfied that the information I included in this email to Alwen

   Lyons was accurate because it would have been an agreed approach using

   information and opinions gathered from relevant subject experts. I wouldn't

   question the information provided by subject experts that I pulled together for a

                                                                                   WITNO9910100




   briefing to the Board, unless something jumped out at me. I cannot recall a

   situation where this ever occurred.




89.In relation to POL sharing Second Sight's August 2014 report with UKGI/ShEx

   and I or government, I think I saw it as being ultimately a matter for the Board, as

   is indicated in my email to Richard Callard on 25 September 2014

   (POL00101398). The Inquiry will see from this email that I also thought it was

   important for the Working Group, or at least the Chair, to be consulted on the

   matter of sharing the report with Ministers should POL wish to do so as POL, like

   all members of the Working Group, was subject to the confidentiality restrictions

   relating to the Working Group. I believe the August 2014 Second Sight report was

   shared with ShEx/UKGI, because ShEx was represented on the Board and the

   Board members would, I assume, have received a copy of the report.




90.1 do not recall personally briefing the Board, ShEx or Government on POL's

   strategy in its response to the substantive issues raised by applicants and

   Second Sight in the Scheme. The Board would, I assume, have seen the various

   Second Sight reports and POL's response to them, and then been able ask any

   further questions of the subject experts. I may then have provided the Board with

   whatever briefing it asked for, and what the General Counsel asked me to give. I

   do not know whether the Second Sight reports were ever given to Ministers and,

   if so, whether they asked any further questions following receipt.

Criminal cases and new expert:

91. 1 do not recall having any involvement in POL's review of criminal convictions

   secured using data generated by the Horizon IT System. I may have been aware

   of this work happening, but this would have been dealt with by POL's legal team

   and would have been outside of my responsibility and expertise_




92. 1 also do not believe I had any involvement POL's approach to Professor Kramer

   and Dr Dulay to prepare an expert report on Horizon — again, this was a matter

   which would have been dealt with by POL's legal team. If I were involved then I

   have no recollection of it and it could only have been in some peripheral way.




93.1 do not recall my email to Patrick Bourke and others on 23 October 2014 at

   (POL00091397), nor do I know what James Davidson meant when writing "The

   continued failure of Second Sight (and now potentially Imperial College) to

   acknowledge (or at worst engage with) this core principle results in much of the

   frustration...". I do not recall what occurred after I forwarded this to Patrick

   Bourke with my further questions. It was often the case that something crossed

   my desk which I thought it may be important and beyond my role and expertise,

   and I would pass it on to others in POL with the knowledge and expertise to deal

   with it. Generally I would only follow things up if they directly affected the Scheme

   or the Working Group, otherwise I would assume that they would have been

   picked up and dealt with by those responsible_

95. 1 do not recall the specific reasons as to why POL considered alternatives to the

   Scheme again in late 2014 / early 2015. As mentioned previously in this

   statement, it was my understanding that the Working Group and the Scheme

   were under continuous review by the Board, the Sub-Committee and ExCo

   throughout my involvement in the Scheme. It seems that there was an ExCo

   discussion about the Scheme which is referenced at (POL00021908), following

   which the incoming General Counsel, Jane MacLeod, put a proposal to the Sub-

   Committee jointly with Mark Davies, Communications Director, suggesting

   amendments to the Scheme in February 2015 (POL00102162). I do not recall

   that discussion and do not believe I was involved in it. The document at

   (POL00006574) suggests that the proposal was agreed in principle by the Sub-

   Committee on 18 February 2015, subject to notification of the Board and the

   completion of some further work. As far as I recall there was a further discussion

   between the new POL General Counsel and the CEO, shortly after the Sub-

   Committee meeting, which I attended, which resulted in bringing forward the

   amendments to the Scheme that the Sub-Committee had agreed. I cannot recall

   specifically what prompted that but I think it may have been as a result of me

   asking the new POL General Counsel how she wanted the Programme Team to

   handle the upcoming Working Group meeting in view of the fact that a decision

   had been made to alter the Scheme.




96. 1 was clearly involved in some, but not all discussions on amending/closing the

   Scheme. Ultimately it was the Sub-Committee, presumably endorsed by the

   Board, that decided. As far as I recall my view was that it was a matter for POL to

   decide what it wanted to do. I think that I felt that if the original idea of the

   Scheme was aimed at hearing SPM complaints with a view to resolving

   complaints and drawing a line under the matter, then it had not worked. If

   anything, some SPMs and JFSA seemed less happy than when the Scheme

   started, Second Sight was publicly critical of POL and there was, as far as I

   recall, a notification of legal action by a group of SPMs in the future. As such, I

   agreed that there was little point in carrying on with the Scheme in the same

   format, as long as those applicants remaining in the Scheme were able to have

   their complaints investigated and mediated as they had been expecting. I was

   also leaving shortly, so whatever decision was made I was unlikely to be involved

   in the next steps.




97_ In terms of what POL wanted out of the Scheme and the Working group, from the

   documents provided to me I cannot see that the outcomes POL desired were

   achieved. This may be the reason why a decision was taken to close down the

   Working Group and Scheme. I think (and hope) that at least a small number of

   applicants in the Scheme who submitted a complaint which was resolved were

   satisfied.

     iv.   (POL00108462) - engagement letter dated 9 April 2014;

     v.    (POL00138270) - email from Gareth James to Chris Aujard and others on

     vi.   (POL00328471) - email from Gareth James to Lesley Sewell on 29 April

           2014 and the attachment (POL00294440);

     vii. (POL00147957) - email from Gareth James to me on 7 April 2014; and

     viii. (POL00107160) - Deloitte report dated 23 May 2014.




99.1 do not know where the name `Project Zebra' came from and as far as I can

   recall I only had a tangential role in commissioning the work from Deloitte_ I

   believe I was asked to assist POL General Counsel and the CIO to commission

   the work for the Board, but I do not know who was responsible for deciding the

   ambit of "Project Zebra" or why it was limited to a review of assurance work,

   rather than an investigation in itself. It seems that this was a matter for the Board,

   POL General Counsel and the CIO, as indicated by the email chain at

   (POL00147957), where I appear to be coordinating the work by forwarding my

   discussions with Deloitte to relevant people, and helping to arrange a meeting

   between Deloitte and the CIO to finalise the scope of the project.




100. I have no recollection of what POL did with the reports produced by Deloitte

   and I suspect that I never engaged with the content of such reports. It would have

   been for relevant subject experts to decide whether it raised any matter of

   importance and for the Board to decide whether the contents gave it the

   reassurances it required in relation to Horizon. As such, I do not think I would

   have had any views on the contents of these reports.




POL's approach to journalists

101. I confirm that I have considered the following documents:

     i.     (POL00149829) - email from Melanie Corfield to me on 5 December

            2014);

     ii.    (POL00109547) - email exchange between me and Mark Davies on 7

            November 2014;

     iii.   (POL00101712) - email from me to Mark Davies on 8 December 2014;

            and

     iv.    (POL00101728) - email from me to Melanie Corfield on 9 December 2014.




102. I was sometimes asked for a view on how POL should respond to journalists

   raising issues regarding the Horizon IT System, but I had no authority to make

   the final decisions on this and my input generally related to matters regarding the

   Scheme and the Working Group. I also liaised with Comms if anything arose in

   relation the Scheme requiring a Comms response. However, I am not a Comms

   expert, so any view that I did provide on how to respond to journalists, or what

   should be in a Comms response, would have been a lay-person's view, and

   ultimately may not have been followed. I imagine my general view would have

   been to engage as little as possible while the Scheme was running but ultimately

   such decisions were not for me to make.

                                                                                   WITNO9910100




103.   1 do not recall if POL had a specific strategy on responding to journalists. As

   far as I was aware, journalist enquiries were dealt with on a case by case basis.




Leaving POL

104.   As mentioned earlier in this statement, I left POL on 31 March 2015 to retire. I

   had always intended to retire at this point, and I recall making that clear before

   signing my full time contract with POL. There was no other reason as to why I left

   POL at this time.




General

105.   1 was not involved in any of the following matters: (1) POL prosecutions of

   SPMs, which, to the best of my knowledge had ceased before my involvement in

   the Scheme (2) the disclosure of information to SPMs convicted on the basis of

   Horizon data (which was an ongoing exercise as far as I am aware which was

   undertaken by lawyers and (3) GLO proceedings, which occurred after my

   retirement .




106.   My involvement in the Scheme was approximately 18 months and I feel that I

   can only reflect on this short time period, based on the knowledge that I had at

   that time. I do not remember for certain how many prosecutions I understood

   POL had brought since Horizon was introduced, but I think I believed it to be

   around 200. I cannot now recall where I got that figure from. There were less than

   150 applications to the Scheme, and of this number between 30 and 40 of the

                                   Page 51 of 68
                                                                                     WITNO9910100
                                                                                   WITNO9910100




   complaints related to cases involving a criminal prosecution. In light of these

   figures I agreed with POL that the numbers were small compared to the total

   number of Horizon users. I understood there to be a high level of confidence in

   POL at senior levels, and I think NFSP, about the integrity of Horizon. Due to this,

   I honestly believed at the time that POL was getting the balance right between

   investigating complaints and defending the integrity of its systems. I now

   understand that the number of Horizon related prosecutions and complaints are

   far greater than anything that I was aware of during my involvement in the

   Scheme. However, in absence of this knowledge at the time, I do not know how I

   would have been able to do anything differently in relation to handling challenges

   to the integrity of the Horizon IT System by SPMs, Members of Parliament,

   journalists and members of the public.




107_   Having now read the Helen Rose and Deloitte reports with the information I

   have gleaned from the Inquiry, the various court cases and media reports during

   the years since I left POL, I have considered whether I should have engaged

   further with those reports and other substantive issues that crossed my desk

   (even though this fell outside the scope of my role), and if so, whether this would

   have made any difference to where matters are today. However, given the

   technicalities of those reports and the substantive matters relating to the Horizon

   IT system, I do not think I would have understood the issues enough to

   comfortably challenge or question what the subject experts were saying about

   Horizon, or even realise there was a potential need to challenge any assurances.

108. I would like to express to the Inquiry how sorry I am to the SPMs and their

   families who have been affected. I have watched with incredulity as the situation

   has changed in comparison to how I understood matters to be when I left POL on

   31 March 2015, to where we are now.




109.   Other than the matters addressed within this statement, there are no other

   matters that I would like to bring to the attention of the Chair of the Inquiry.




I believe the content of this statement to be true.
