                             POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




                   FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF NATASHA BERNARD




I , Natasha Bernard, will say as follows:

   1. This witness statement is made following a request from the Post Office Horizon Inquiry

       ("Inquiry") dated 23 August 2023, for information pursuant to Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules

       2006 — Request number 1, regarding matters falling within Phase 4 of the Inquiry: action

       taken by Post Office Ltd against Subpostmasters.



   2. I left the Post Office over 12 years ago and a lot of the questions raised in the Rule 9

       request relate to matters nearly 20 years ago. This passage of time has meant that I

       have found it difficult to recall specific details and have had to rely heavily on the

       documents provided to me as part of the Rule 9 request to answer the Inquiry's

       questions. However, I have done my best to assist the Inquiry to the best of my

       recollection and will continue to assist the Inquiry in any way I can.



   3. I can confirm that I have had legal assistance in responding to the Rule 9 request and

       drafting this statement. In order to obtain insurance for this legal assistance, I was in

       contact with the Post Office who provided me with the relevant contacts. I have not had

       any contact with the Post Office other than to obtain legal insurance coverage.

                                                                                        WITNO9390100




Relevant background

  4. I commenced employment with Post Office Ltd on 10 September 1985 as a Counter

     Clerk. On 6 April 1998 I was an Assistant Branch Manager at Acton Crown Office and

     stayed in this role until 5 June 2000 when I was promoted to an Investigation Manager

     ("Security Advisor") in South London. I subsequently left employment with Post Office

     Ltd on 25 February 2011, before starting work as a Fraud Disputes and Control Analyst

     at CCUK Finance Ltd from 9 August 2011 until 31 October 2016.



  5. From November 2016 to August 2017 I was unemployed. From August 2017 to October

     2017 I was self-employed, training individuals as an Accredited Counter-Fraud

     Specialist ("ACFS"). In November 2017 I commenced employment as an Executive

     Officer Work Coach for The Department for Work and Pensions and remain in this role

     to date.



  6. In respect of my position as a Security Advisor, I came into the role after bumping into

     Tony Utting, who I knew from school. I think that he was Head of Investigations at the

     time and told me that vacancies were coming up in January 2000 for the Security and

     Investigations Team. I applied and was successful, starting on 5 June 2000. I cannot

     recall the exact dates but in my final years of working at the Post Office, I managed the

     Banking Fraud Team.


  7. I can recall the job title changing and, in the main, I was called an 'Investigation

     Manager' and not a 'Security Advisor'. I have therefore used the job title 'Investigation

     Manager going forward.



  8. Prior to becoming an Investigation Manager I had experience working on counters and

     managing branch offices. When I started my role as an Investigation Manager I went on


                                           -2-
                                                                                        WITNO9390100
                                                                                     WITN09390100




   a Security Foundation course. Further details on this are below at "Training, instructions

   and guidance to investigators within the Security and Investigation Team".



9. I was assigned a mentor, David Posnett, who I could seek guidance and support from

   and who I shadowed at the beginning of my role. My line manager was Paul Fielding

   and I also worked a lot with Tony Utting.



10. My role as an Investigation Manager was to carry out investigations into criminal

   offences committed against the Post Office, dealing with both Sub Post Offices and

   Branch Offices. The investigations I was involved with weren't just relating to audit

   shortages, but also other issues, such as suspected fraud. Where an audit shortage

   occurred, the Security and Investigation Team would get a call from the audit team, who

   would have attended the Sub Post Office for an audit and found a shortage. This was

   usually on a Thursday, as the Sub Postmaster would have declared their cash the night

   before. The team manager would then assign the case to somebody in the Security and

   Investigation Team to attend the Sub Post Office and investigate further. Who they

   assigned it to would generally depend on who was nearby and available, meaning I

   tended to do mostly South London based investigations.


11. Following an investigation, from what I remember, we would write a report to the

   Contracts and Services Manager. This report was only allowed to contain facts about

   what had happened and not an opinion. We would also write a report to the Criminal

   Law Team, which also summarised what had happened but in which you could express

   an opinion on next steps, including a recommendation on charges. I thought that we

   also wrote a third report but I cannot recall, and the documents do not assist me in

   recalling, what the content or purpose of the third report was or who it was written for.

                                                                                          WITN09390100
                                                                                     WITNO9390100




12. I can remember the role specification changing a lot but I think that there was, at one

   point, a division between Security and Investigation roles. From memory, someone who

   had a `Security' role would deal with the physical security of a post office branch, for

   example when there was a burglary. Someone who had an 'investigation' role would

   deal with issues such as internal fraud and audit shortages. However, my memory on

   this is limited and I cannot remember details about times or specific roles or

   responsibilities. I do, however, recall that the roles were, at one point, combined.



13. Overall, I thought my colleagues were brilliant. I can recall Tony Utting red marking my

   first report all over and really helping me to improve. Everyone was very professional

   and respectful and even though we had a laugh with each other, we were very serious

   when it came to the job and standards were very high.




14.As an Investigations Manager I had no involvement in disciplinary matters. After we

   conducted an investigation, we would write a report to assist the Contracts and Services

   Manager, an example being document [POL00044360]. This report had to be entirely

   facts based, with no opinion given. Beyond writing the report, we had no involvement in

   any decisions taken.



15. My role included carrying out interviews under caution of those accused of a criminal

   offence. I had full training on how to carry out interviews under caution and they were

   always carried out with another member of the team present. Before commencing the

   interview, we would always inform the individual of their right to legal representation and

   a friend.



16. In terms of disclosure in criminal or civil proceedings, once we had written our legal

   report, we would submit it to the Criminal Law Team with the relevant documents. They

                                        -4-
                                                                                         WITNO9390100
                                                                                       WITN09390100




   would review it and give their advice. If their advice was to prosecute, they would list

   additional documents and evidence that they required. For example, witness

   statements. It would be our job to source and provide this. Should further information or

   evidence be needed during the lifetime of a case, the Criminal Law Team would contact

   us and we would assist in obtaining and providing it. I cannot recall having any official

   role in relation to disclosure other than sourcing and providing documents as and when

   requested. I also cannot recall whether I ever had any specific training on disclosure

   whilst working at the Post Office.



17. I had no involvement in litigation case strategy. When I submitted my legal report to the

   Criminal Law Team, I might recommend what the Sub Postmaster could be charged

   with, but it is my recollection that ultimately any charging decision was up to the Criminal

   Law Team. I can recall occasionally sitting in on conferences with Counsel who would

   ask questions about the evidence, but this was to provide information only, not to talk

   about litigation strategy.



18. My role included liaising with other Post Office departments. I can remember that there

   was a Casework Function Team. This department included the Casework Manager,

   who would start the initial process, sending cases to our team leader who would then

   hand them down to us to take forward. The name of the department changed a lot so it

   may have been called something else during my time.



19. Once we had carried out the investigation, we would submit the case to the Criminal

   Law Team who would look at the evidence and draft advice on prosecution. If

   prosecution was going ahead, we would prepare the committal and issue the summons.

   We might also liaise with the Criminal Law Team throughout the lifetime of a case if they

   requested further information and/or evidence. I can also recall getting in touch

                                                                                       WITNO9390100




      occasionally with the Financial Investigation Unit although I cannot remember why. I

      assume it was to assist them in obtaining financial information.

The Security and Investigation Team's role in relation to criminal investigations and

prosecutions

   20. The Inquiry have provided me with a number of policies to assist in answering their

      questions on the above subject matter. A lot of these policies post-date the time that I

      left the Post Office (February 2011) and therefore I have not reviewed any of the

      documents after this date. To confirm, I have reviewed the following:



         i.   Casework Management Policy (version 1.0, March 2000) ([POL00104747]) and

              (version 4.0, October 2002) ([POL00104777]);

21. 1 did not remember the Casework and Management Policies ([POL00104747]

   and [POL00104777]) prior to being provided them by the Inquiry. However,

   having reviewed them, I remember that I would use them to guide me with




                                    -7-
                                                                                       WITN09390100
                                                                                      WITNO9390100




   what needed to be contained in the legal report. I do not specifically

   remember the Post Office Ltd policies listed above, although I appreciate that

   I would have been aware of them at the time of my employment. I do not

   recall any of the Royal Mail Group policies and it is less likely that I would

   have been aware of them at the time of my employment.



22. I did not have any role in the development and / or management of any of the

   policies listed above.



23.The organisational structure of the Security and Investigation Team changed

   so often during my employment in it that I find it difficult to remember how it

   was at any particular time. I can recall that, at one point, it was divided into

   lots of different sub-teams, two of which I think were called `Fraud Risk' and

   `Commercial Risk'. When I left, things were starting to change again but I

   cannot remember how.



24. The policies listed above governed the conduct of investigations conducted by

   the Security and Investigation Team and as part of the Fraud Investigation

   and Prosecution Policy ([POL00030580]), we had to ensure adherence and

   compliance with the following:

      a. Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984

      b. Data Protection Act 1998

      c. The Data Protection (Processing of Sensitive Personal Data) Order

          2000

      d. Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) 2000
                                                                                      WITNO9390100
                                                                                   WITN09390100




       e. Human Rights Act 1998

       f. Criminal Procedures and Investigations Act 1996



25. I was not involved in the development of any policies within the Post Office

   post-separation and cannot recall that the separation had any impact in

   relation to the way investigations were conducted.



26. I do not remember what the process was for dealing with complaints about the

   conduct of an investigation by the Security and Investigation team and cannot

   recall any specific complaints happening.



27. In terms of supervision over criminal investigations, once we had written our

   report, it would go to our line manager who would review it and make sure we

   had exhausted every line of enquiry. Sometimes you would submit a report

   and they would give it back to you, suggesting other avenues of enquiry that

   you needed to pursue. If I had any queries, I would go to my supervisor to ask

   for help and they would always be very approachable and you felt like you

   could challenge them if you disagreed.



28. I do not think that the Post Office policy and practice regarding investigation

   and prosecution of Crown Office employees differed at all from the policy and

   practice and regarding investigation and prosecution of Sub Postmasters or

   their managers or assistants. Personally, I would always treat them the same.

   The only difference would have been that we had more control when going

   into a Branch Office as this was Post Office property, whereas if you were
                                                                                       WITN09390100
                                                                                    WITNO9390100




      going to a Sub Postmasters office, there was an extra layer of risk

      assessment as often, if it was part of the Sub Postmaster's house.

Audit and investigation

   29. The Inquiry have asked me to consider the document `Condensed Guide for

      Audit Attendance' (version 2, October 2008) ([POL00104821]). However, this

      document looks like it is for auditors and I do not remember ever having seen

      it before.



   30.An investigator would not attend an audit but would be called afterwards, if a

      shortfall had been discovered in the audit. Upon attendance, you would speak

      to the auditor who would let you know if the Sub Postmaster had made any

      significant statement explaining the cause of the shortfall. You would then

      start to gather facts and inform the Sub Postmaster that you needed to

      interview them under caution.



   31.An investigation would always happen following an audit where a shortfall was

      discovered if it was more than a nominal amount. I cannot remember what the

      threshold amount was. I think that reports were reviewed by our line manager,

      and can recall that this was certainly the case when we did not have much

      experience. However, I think that once we became more experienced, our

      reports would be sent direct to the Criminal Law Team but could be reviewed

      by our line manager beforehand on request.



   32. I believe that it was up to the Contracts and Service Manager to decide

      whether a Sub Postmaster would remain as a Sub Postmaster or whether a
                                                                                       WITNO9390100
                                                                                    WITNO9390100




      temporary Sub Postmaster would take over. As noted above, we would issue

      a report to help them make a decision but were not involved in the actual

      decision making process and our report had to be facts only.



   33. If, when carrying out an investigation, there was suspected fraud involved, I

      would raise this to the Criminal Law Team in my legal report as a potential

      offence.


The process followed by Security and Investigation Team investigators when

conducting a criminal investigation following the identification of a shortfall at

an audit


   34.As described above, once a decision had been made to conduct a criminal

      investigation, we would attend the Sub Postmasters Post Office to gather

      facts and interview them under caution. The investigation would have followed

      the inquiry methods as detailed in 3.1 of document [POL00030687]

      `Investigation Procedures'.


Decisions about prosecutions and criminal enforcement proceedings


   35. Following an initial investigation, it was the Criminal Law Team who would

      decide whether a Sub Postmaster, their manager(s) or a Crown Office

      employee should be prosecuted. Although we could write recommendations in

      our legal report, it was up to the Criminal Law Team to decide what charges to

      bring. I cannot speak for the rest of the Security and Investigation Team but,

      unless it was glaringly wrong, I would not challenge a decision on the charges

      to be brought by the Criminal Law Team. I knew that there was a test applied

      by those making prosecution and charging decisions, but I do not remember

      what this was. I do not think that the Contract and Services Manager had any

      input into the prosecution decision-making process. I think that they were only

      involved with the discipline aspect of the case and the Criminal Law Team

      were involved in the legal aspect.



   36. I was not involved in any restraint of a suspect's assets, as this was dealt with

      by the Financial Investigation Unit. We would tell them about the case and

      they would look at it to see if criminal proceedings should be pursued. As I

      was not involved in this, I do not feel able to comment on what factors they

      considered when making decisions around this.

Training, instructions and guidance to investigators within the Security and

Investigation Team

   37. When I began my role within the Security and Investigation Team, I completed

      the Security Foundation Course, which provided training on a wide range of

      skills, including carrying out interviews, taking witness statements, conducting

      searches, obtaining evidence and drafting investigation reports. I remember

      that there were about 17 modules in total. The course had two exams, both of

      which you needed to pass to carry on the role. This training included being

      made aware of Post Office policies around the duty on an investigator to

      investigate a case fully and what this meant in practice. I also shadowed

      David Posnett for the couple of few months to receive additional instructions

      and guidance on investigations, before taking on my first case around August

      2000.

   38. I can also recall having training on how the Horizon system worked and that it

      essentially worked as a giant calculator.



   39. As referenced above, 3.1 of the Casework and Management Policies

      ([POL00104747] and [POL00104777]) laid out what needed to be included in

      the legal report. You would have to assume that the legal team knew nothing

      about the Post Office so would explain everything from the background of the

      case, to the resultant shortage. You would then make recommendations and

      say whether you had identified any weaknesses in the case.




Analysing Horizon data and requesting ARQ data from Fujitsu




  40. In answering the Inquiry's questions on this subject matter, I can confirm that I

      have reviewed the following documents-



              The document entitled "Conducting Audit Data Extractions at CSR"

              dated 4 May 2000 at [POL00029169];

          reviewed the other versions of this document as they post-date my

          employment.

     v.   The documents entitled "Security Management Service: Service

          ([FUJ00002033]), 31 December 2008 ([FUJ00080107]) and 15

          October 2010 ([FUJ00002264]). Please note that I have not reviewed

          the other versions of this document as they post-date my employment.



41. To confirm, whenever I dealt with an investigation for a shortfall, I would

   usually request ARQ data from Fujitsu as part of my investigation. I did this as

   a matter of course, not because of any suspected issue with Horizon and in

   fact, I do not recall that I ever dealt with a case where the Sub Postmaster

   raised issues with Horizon at the time.



42. 1 remember that there was a process to request ARQs but I cannot remember

   what it was. I remember speaking to Penny Thomas at Fujitsu but I do not

   know whether she was responsible for the provision of data or authorising an

   ARQ request.



43. I think that there was a limit on the number of ARQ requests which would be

   provided by Fujitsu but I cannot recall amounts and this was not something

   that I was involved in. I remember that sometimes we were told to hold back

   requests until the following month because the data request limit had been

   reached.

                                                                                 WITN09390100




44. I do not remember whether there was a difference between Legacy Horizon

   and Horizon Online when it came to requesting ARQ data. I do not know what

   Legacy Horizon is.



45. I have been asked about my recollection of obtaining audit data. It is my

   assumption that what is meant by this, is data available to or obtained by an

   auditor as part of an audit. I can recall, on occasions, requesting an auditor to

   run reports from the Horizon system. However, the report was difficult and

   lengthy to look through as it presented itself on a long piece of paper which

   wound up like a ball of receipts. It was much easier to instead request the

   data from Fujitsu as they could present it on an excel spreadsheet which was

   easier to read.



46. I cannot recall whether or not the data was provided to the Sub Postmaster

   but I assume that it would have been during disclosure. If relevant, an extract

   from a report might be provided to the Criminal Law Team within the

   investigation documents.




47. Any data that was obtained by Fujitsu was presented in a spreadsheet for the

   relevant period that you requested it for. This spreadsheet was given to you

   on a disc. As noted above, I remember speaking to Penny Thomas but I

   cannot recall the circumstances around these conversations. I cannot recall

   anybody called Gareth Jenkins or what their role was.

   48. 1 do not know what prosecution support Fujitsu was contractually obliged to

      provide to Post Office. I had nothing to do with contractual arrangements with

      Fujitsu and do not feel able to comment on any contractual requirements on

      them, either in relation to Legacy Horizon or Horizon Online.

Relationship with others

   49. I cannot recall having any involvement with Cartwright King Solicitors.



   50. I did not have any involvement with the National Federation of Sub

      Postmasters other than to ask a Sub Postmaster if they wanted somebody

      from the National Federation of Sub Postmasters to be present when we

      interviewed them under caution. I do not remember any direct interaction that

      I had with them.

Prosecution of Ms Adedayo

   51.The Inquiry have asked me for a full and detailed account of the investigation

      and prosecution of Oyeteju Adedayo. At the outset, I would like to say that I

      have no direct memory of the case. I have had to rely wholly on the

      documents provided to me to be able to provide my answers and only been

      able to expand where I can comment on general practices and procedures.



   52. In consideration of Ms Adedayo's case I can confirm that I have reviewed the

      following documents:



         a. the witness statement of Ms Adedayo [WITN09390100];

          b. the audit report [POL00068926];

                                                                               WITNO9390100




53. I have also read Ms Adedayo's Impact Statement [WITN01780100].



54. Document [POL00044360] lays out a summary of how I came to be involved

   in Ms Adedayo's case. This confirms that, on Monday 5 September 2005,

   Branch Auditor, Mr Deepak Valani, attended Rainham Road Sub Post Office

   Branch to conduct a routine cash and stock verification audit. The audit

   resulted in a shortage of £52,864.08. The Security and Investigation Team

   were immediately informed and I went into the branch that same day to

   commence an investigation.


55. Document [POL00068926] shows that the auditor, Mr Deepak Valani wrote to

   me on 5 September 2005 to inform me that there was a shortfall and a

   decision was taken to suspend Ms Adedayo. I do not know who made this

   decision but it would probably have been the Contract and Services Manager.



56. The document shows that I was involved in the initial investigation and carried

   out an interview under caution, along with Adrian Morris, but I cannot

   remember anything beyond what is contained in the two transcripts of this

   interview [POL00066742] (part 1) and [POL00066745] (part 2). I would have

   written the legal report [POL00044366] following the interview and the

   Criminal Legal Team would have made the decision as to whether to

   prosecute and under what charges. I would have also written the report to the

   Contracts and Services Manager [POL00044360]. Again, this was all normal

   practice.

                                                                                   WITNO9390100




57. I have considered the transcript of Ms Adedayos' evidence to the Inquiry on

   21 February 2022 [INO00001039], pages 60 to 104. Here, Ms Adedayo

   described that on the day of the initial audit of her branch (5 September 2005)

   there were "plain clothes police officers" in attendance (see page 76, lines 18

   to 20). I am not a police officer and have never presented myself as such.

   When we attended investigations, we would show identification and so I do

   not think that she can be referring to me at this point.



58. 1 cannot recall what information was provided to me in respect of the audit.

   However, it was usual for auditors to provide us with information about the

   shortage and any explanation that the Sub Postmaster had given. Having

   reviewed my legal and disciplinary reports at [POL00044360] and

   [POL00044366], I assume that the auditors would have told me of the

   shortfall of £52,864.08 and that Ms Adedayo had informed the auditors, prior

   to the commencement of the audit, that the accounts would be approximately

   £50k short and wrote a note to that effect. However, this is only my

   assumption and not based on my memory. I did not have any involvement in

   the audit of this branch as that was not part of my job role.



59. During her evidence to the Inquiry [INQ00001039] at page 84, Ms Adedayo

   states that after she was interviewed she had been told "You'd better get

   yourself a lawyer because you're going to go down for a very long time and

   we are going to make sure that you never work again". I am not aware of this

   or words to that effect having ever been communicated to Ms Adedayo or any




                                    I
                                                                                     WITN09390100
                                                                                   WITNO9390100




   Sub Postmaster who I interviewed. I would have been shocked if someone

   said that as it is completely inappropriate. Had I ever heard anything said to

   this effect, I would have told my line manager and would have reported it.

   Although I cannot remember the interview of Ms Adedayo I am confident that I

   would have remembered something as serious as this being said as it is so

   shocking.



60 Besides Adrian Morris, who I can see from the transcripts interviewed Ms

   Adedayo with me, I cannot recall anyone else at the Post Office who provided

   assistance to the investigation apart from the auditors.



61. I do not think that I obtained legal advice at any stage of the investigation prior

   to sending my report to the Criminal Law Team. That document is at

   [POL00044366].



62. I cannot remember the sources of evidence that I considered during the

   course of the investigation. However, I would normally have considered what

   the audit showed, what any Horizon data showed and what she said on the

   day. I cannot remember if we also interviewed Joan, who Ms Adedayo refers

   to, or took a witness statement from her.



63. At no point was I aware of any allegations made by Ms Adedayo relating to

   the reliability of the Horizon IT system. At the outset and throughout the

   lifetime of the case, she consistently said that she had taken the money. She




                                     -20-
                                                                                      WITN09390100
                                                                                   WITNO9390100




   never attributed the shortfall to issues with the Horizon system. Had she done,

   I would have made further investigations.



64. I cannot remember whether Fujitsu were contacted to provide any additional

   data in relation to this case. I would like to think that ARQ logs were sought,

   but I also might have relied on the logs printed on the day. I cannot

   remember.



65. In respect of my role in relation to the prosecution of Ms Adedayo, I was the

   lead investigator which essentially involved conducting the initial investigation,

   including an interview under caution and preparing the reports and putting

   together the case file.



66. I do not think that I was the Disclosure Officer in this case and I cannot ever

   remember holding this official title. Although I did assist with sourcing and

   providing information when requested, I had no direct involvement in actually

   disclosing it.



67. Document [POL00052911] is a memo from Debbie Helszajn, which states

   that Ms Adedayo appeared at Chatham Magistrates Court on 19 January

   2006 and pleaded guilty to the three charges and accepted the further

   offences set out in the Schedule of TIC's. She advises that I should attend the

   sentencing hearing. This was a normal course of action as all Investigation

   Managers were asked to attend sentencing hearings and write something up

   after the sentencing to conclude the case. I have no direct memory of the




                                     -21-
                                                                                         WITNO9390100
                                                                                     WITNO9390100




     sentencing hearing and therefore cannot confirm whether or not I did actually

     attend. However, it would not have been unusual for me to arrange for

     someone else from the team to go in my place if I could not attend.



  68. The only involvement that I had in the financial investigation was to provide a

     summary to the Financial Investigation Unit ("FIU") to help them understand

     the case. It would have been the FIU who made the decision to commence

     confiscation proceedings in respect of Ms Adedayo, not me. I had no

     involvement in the confiscation proceedings. Beyond what is contained in the

     documents, I cannot recall any further involvement that I had in this case.



  69. I do not have any other reflections about this matter that I think are relevant,

     other than to make clear that I never had any knowledge of any problems with

     Horizon and no reason to suspect that there was anything wrong with the

     Horizon system.




General


  70. I cannot remember ever having a case where the integrity of Horizon was

     brought into question. I was shocked when all of the cases came out about it

     as I cannot recall anyone ever saying to me that a shortfall was due to

     Horizon when I conducted any of my investigations. I always kept an open

     mind during an investigation and if a Sub Postmaster had said that there was

     a problem, I would have been looking for it during my investigation. I never let

     something go if I thought there was an issue which hadn't been resolved in

     any aspect of my work.

   71. Given that the issue of Horizon was never raised to me, I do not feel that I can

          comment as to whether I consider sufficient information regarding bugs, errors

         and defects in Horizon was passed to the Post Office by Fujitsu.



   72. I can only comment on my own cases and only feel able to repeat that the

          issue of Horizon was never brought up. Had it arisen, I would have

          investigated it further.



   73. There are no other matters that I wish to bring to the attention of the Chair of

         the Inquiry.
