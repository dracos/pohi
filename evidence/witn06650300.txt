                                                            Dated: 14 September 2023

      THIRD CORPORATE STATEMENT OF FUJITSU SERVICES LIMITED




INTRODUCTION


1.   I am a director of Fujitsu Services Limited ("Fujitsu") and am duly authorised to

     make this statement on its behalf. I make this statement in response to the

     Inquiry's Rule 9 Requests, dated 16 June 2023 and 31 July 2023, fora corporate

     statement addressing issues relevant to Phases 3 and 4 of the Inquiry (the

     "Requests"). In particular, the Requests focus on the provision and content of

     Audit Record Query ("ARQ") data by Fujitsu to Post Office Limited ("POL") over

     time.


2.   As noted in the First and Second Corporate Statements dated 28 September

     2022 and 29 December 2022 respectively (the "First and Second Corporate

     Statements"), I do not have first-hand knowledge of many of the matters which

     are set out in this corporate statement. For this reason, I wish to reiterate at the

     outset how the information in this statement has been compiled. As with the

     responses in the First and Second Corporate Statements, responses to

                                                                                           WITNO6650300




     questions set out in this statement are generally drawn from documentary

     sources. For the purposes of preparing this statement, I have been assisted by

     a team of individuals within Fujitsu and Morrison Foerster. This is due to the vast

     amount of documentation and sources of evidence which have had to be

     reviewed for a time period stretching over 25 years. This team has provided to

     me the documents which are referenced in this statement and exhibited in

     accordance with the index at the back of this statement, and which are the

     principal source of my knowledge of this statement's content. In addition to

     available documentary evidence, I have also been provided with the witness

     statements of three Fujitsu employees (John Simpkins, Jonathan Hulme and

     Gerald Barnes) who have also provided responses to the Requests based on

     their own personal knowledge or recollections (the "Fujitsu Witness

     Statements").


3.   The responses provided in this third corporate statement represent Fujitsu's

     current understanding of the information available. Given that work in relation to

     Phase 4 and other phases of the Inquiry is still on-going, it may be that Fujitsu

     will need to supplement this corporate statement as further material is identified

     and made available to Core Participants.


4.   Further, as noted in the First and Second Corporate Statements, I do not have a

     detailed technical knowledge of the Horizon IT System ("Horizon") and I am

     reliant upon Fujitsu staff with relevant technical expertise and knowledge of such

     matters.

5.   For ease of reference, in this statement:


          a.    ICL Pathway Limited (which initially managed the Horizon contract,

                and later novating the contract to Fujitsu Services Limited) and Fujitsu

                Services Limited will be referred to collectively as "Fujitsu"; and


          b.   Post Office Counters Limited (subsequently Post Office Limited) will

                be referred to collectively as "POL").


CONTRACTUAL BACKGROUND

6.   From the outset of Horizon, Fujitsu has been required by contract to maintain an

     audit trail of "all Transactions and Events..." (see for example paragraph 3.1 of

     Schedule A03 to the Codified Agreement entered into between Fujitsu and POL

     on 28 July 1999 (the "1999 Codified Agreement"), and paragraph 3.1 of

     Schedule 05 to version 13 of the Codified Agreement which was entered into by

     Fujitsu and POL on 23 November 2020 (the "2020 Codified Agreement")).' This

     contractual obligation flowed from Requirement 699 contained at paragraph

     1.102 of Schedule A15 to the 1999 Codified Agreement. In particular,

     Requirement 699 notes at:


          a.   Paragraph 1.102.6: "The content of the audit trail shall be agreed with

               POCL by a date consistent with the Project Plan."


          b.   Paragraph 1.102.9: "The audit trail shall have a level of security such

                that it cannot be altered or deleted."

                                                                                              WITNO6650300




           c.   Paragraph 1.102.11: "The audit trail shall comply with Requirement

                 829", namely the prosecution support Requirement set out at

                 paragraph 1.133 of Schedule A15 to the 1999 Codified Agreement.


7.   Fujitsu's solution for Requirement 699 is set out in Schedule A16 to the 1999

     Codified Agreement. During the course of 1999-2000, this solution was amended

     by Change Control Notice ("CCN") 0423a to include the following additional

     wording "[t]he audit trail is specified in the Audit Trail Functional Specification."2

     CCN 0423a also introduced the Audit Trail Functional Specification document

     (version 3.0 dated 1 July 1999 at the relevant time)3 as a Contract Controlled

     Document ("CCD") to be agreed between Fujitsu and POL. In order to assist the

     Inquiry, Fujitsu sets out at Appendix 1 to this corporate statement a schedule of

     approved Audit Trail Functional Specification documents from version 3.0

     onwards. In accordance with paragraph 3.3 of Schedule D5 to the 2020 Codified

     Agreement, the Audit Trail Functional Specification continues to be a CCD as

     agreed between Fujitsu and POL.


THE ARQ SPREADSHEET

8.   With the first of the Requests, the Inquiry enclosed a spreadsheet containing

     transaction and event data for the Marine Drive Post Office branch with unique

     Financial Accounts Division ("FAD") Code 213337 ("Marine Drive") dating from

     2 February 2004 (the "ARQ Spreadsheet" , 4 pages 17 and 18 only). Fujitsu has

     now been made aware that the ARQ Spreadsheet forms part of a larger

     document. However, for the avoidance of doubt, in preparing this statement,


2
  See CCN 0423a at FUJ00000394, and confirmation that the CCN was approved in the document

                                                                                          WITNO6650300




     Fujitsu understands that the Inquiry requires consideration of pages 17 and 18

     of LCAS0001383 only, and does not require consideration of the remaining

     pages of the document. Fujitsu also understands from the Inquiry that the ARQ

     Spreadsheet was provided to Mr Lee Castleton, a former postmaster of Marine

     Drive, by way of disclosure in the civil case of POL v Lee Castleton.5


9.   By way of background, Fujitsu has to date identified two requests for Audit

     Request Queries (the "ARQ Requests") submitted by Graham Ward (Casework

     Manager, POL) to Fujitsu in relation to Marine Drive for Horizon data dating from

     the period in which Mr Castleton was postmaster at the branch. These ARQ

     Requests are dated 26 October 2005 and 4 November 2005,6 and request

     various data from the period 1 January 2004 to 31 March 2004 (the "ARQ Date

     Range"). The first of the ARQ Requests includes a request for disclosure of the

     following information:


     "Please also conduct an analysis of all Helpdesk calls for the above period,

     commenting on any calls that may indicate faults / problems with the system


     Please also supply a report of all transactions and events for the office for the

     relevant days, including remittances received, transfers between stock units and

     error notices.


     We would like the following format for logs (in Excel format with each category in

     a separate column):

        transaction


       (Session Indicator is whatever way the system has of indicating that individual

        transactions are linked)".


10. The second of the ARQ Requests does not include any reference to Helpdesk

       calls but otherwise appears to be substantially the same as the first. In each of

       the ARQ Requests, Mr Ward confirms that no witness statement is required.


11. It appears from contemporaneous records collected by Fujitsu that (i) the

       Helpdesk call logs requested were provided to POL on a CD on 2 November

       2005 (see email correspondence from Brian Pinder (Security Manager, Fujitsu)

       to Mr Ward on 22 November 2005), and (ii) the ARQ data requested was also

       provided to POL by CD during the course of November 2005 (see email

       correspondence from Mr Pinder to Penny Thomas (Security, Fujitsu) also on

       22 November 2005).8


12. The ARQ extraction process that Fujitsu understands was in place in the context

       of prosecution support at the time the ARQ Requests were made is set out in

       version two of the `Network Banking Management of Prosecution Support'

       procedure document dated 29 February 2005 (the "2005 Prosecution Support

14. According to section 3.3 of the 2005 Prosecution Support Process, the initial step

     for responding to an ARQ request at the time was to identify the search criteria

     to be applied. These search criteria are said to generally have been limited to the

     data fields below, although Fujitsu understands that these fields could be varied

     by POL upon request in the ARQ request:


             a.        the ID for the user logged-on;


             b.        counter position ID;

                                                                                        WITNO6650300




          c.    stock unit reference;


          d.    transaction ID;


          e.    transaction start time and date;


          f.    customer session ID;


          g.    mode (e.g., serve customer);


          h.    product number;


          i.    product quantity; and


          j.    sales value.


15. All of these fields appear to be contained within the ARQ Spreadsheet.


16. In order to obtain the relevant ARQ data, section 7.1 of the 2005 Prosecution

     Support Process explains the steps that the relevant Fujitsu analyst then had to

     take, including:


          a.    Searching and selecting the necessary files from audit archive and

                extract them to the audit server.


          b.    Generating a messagestore for the files extracted.


          c.    Using the RQuery tool to select the fields necessary for the relevant

                ARQ request and then exporting those fields to an Excel 95 document

                (or native format if requested).


          d.    Burning the exported data to a "closed' CD-W' in addition to a Word

                document providing an explanation of the format in which the data was


                                    Page 9 of 103
                                                                                                    WITN06650300
                                                                                                  WITNO6650300




                 provided. According to section 7.1.7 of the 2005 Prosecution Support

                 Process, the CD-W was to be labelled with the ARQ reference

                 number, the FAD Code for the relevant branch, the name of the Fujitsu

                 employee who compiled the data, the date on which compilation of

                 the data was completed, the date range requested in the relevant

                 ARQ request and the name of the Fujitsu employee who checked the

                 data on the CD-W.


           e.    Checking the CD-W for viruses using anti-virus software.


           f.    Despatching the CD-W to the POL Casework Manager by Special

                 Delivery.


17. If these steps were followed in relation to the ARQ Spreadsheet, it follows that

      the data it contained would have been provided to POL in an Excel 95 format on

     a CD-W which was delivered in hard copy by post. It does not appear from the

      contemporaneous process documents available that Fujitsu would have had

      sight of how the information was subsequently shared by POL (either in whole or

      part) with Mr Castleton.


18. Further detail in relation to the practical steps to be taken when extracting audit

     data are set out in the "ARQ Data Extraction Process" documents in place over

      time.10 A schedule of the various ARQ Data Extraction Processes and

     which appear to have been in place over time is set out in Appendix 2 to this

     corporate statement.


19. The Inquiry has asked Fujitsu to confirm whether, in its view, the ARQ data

     provided to POL over time was sufficient to enable a postmaster to understand

     whether Horizon was operating correctly at their branch. In light of (i) the

     evidence heard by the Inquiry from postmasters during the Human Impact

     hearings, (ii) the evidence set out in the Fujitsu Witness Statements, and (iii) the

     matters set out in this corporate statement in relation to the ARQ Spreadsheet,

     Fujitsu cannot confirm that ARQ data on its own was sufficient to enable a

     postmaster to understand whether Horizon was operating correctly at the

     relevant branch in the time period covered by the ARQ data requested by POL.


AVAILABILITY OF ARQ DATA


20. In the first of the Requests, the Inquiry sought disclosure from Fujitsu of the

     "originallog files in their raw form" for the data reflected in the ARQ Spreadsheet.

     The Inquiry also asked for confirmation as to whether the data had been reliably

     and accurately parsed from the "original raw form" to the ARQ Spreadsheet. In

     the context of the ARQ process, Fujitsu understands that "original log data" or

     "raw data files" may refer either to (i) data recorded in the audit archive from

     which the Riposte messagestore in Legacy Horizon and ARQs were extracted,

     or (ii) the Riposte messagestore itself.


21. Fujitsu understands that, until CCN 1122 dated 5 January 2004,11 the retention

     policy for data stored in Fujitsu's audit archive was 18 months.12 Following the

                                                                                           WITNO6650300




     introduction of CCN 1122, this data retention period was increased from

     18 months to 7 years. It appears that this remained the policy until 2014, when

     Commercial Terms ("CT") 1542 dated 2 June 201493 was agreed between POL

     and Fujitsu. In accordance with CT 1542, from around June 2014, data purging

     activities in relation to audit and call data were suspended and this arrangement

     was envisaged to last for 12 months. Since then, the agreement to suspend data

     purging activities relating to audit and call data has been renewed periodically14

     and remains in place at the date of this corporate statement.15 On this basis,

     Fujitsu has retained in its audit archive, audit data dating from around June 2007

     onwards.


22. Fujitsu can therefore confirm that the audit data for Marine Drive within the ARQ

     Date Range is no longer available in its audit archive. The only way that audit

     data from during/before 2007 would now be available to Fujitsu is if employees

     at Fujitsu made copies of the relevant data and stored it separately from the audit

     archive.


23. To identify if any copies of audit data relating to Marine Drive from the time of

     Mr Castleton's tenure as postmaster there still exist outside of the audit archive,

     Fujitsu undertook searches of documents it has collected into hard copy archives

     and its Relativity platform. In doing so, Fujitsu identified a CD labelled "ARQs,

     Message store, Marine Drive, 12/03/04 — 02/04/04". The data from this CD, which

     consisted of two documents, had already been collected and processed into

                                                                                             WITNO6650300




     Fujitsu's Relativity platform at the time of the Requests. The two documents

     contained on the CD are as follows:


           a.     a .txt file containing the Riposte messagestore for Marine Drive for the

                  period 12 March 2004 to 2 April 2004;16 and


           b.     an Excel spreadsheet which appears to split each of the messages in

                  the messagestore described above into separate rows, with a column

                  for each attribute.17


24. Although these documents do not contain the messagestore data for the

     2 February 2004 date reflected in the ARQ Spreadsheet, Fujitsu has produced

     both the above-mentioned documents to the Inquiry and exhibits them to this

     statement.


25. As is clear from the messagestore that has been identified, each message

     relating to Marine Drive began with "<Message:<Groupld:213337>" (213337

     being the FAD Code for the branch). Accordingly, Fujitsu ran searches for this

     identifier across its Relativity platform. Regrettably, no additional responsive

     documents were found. It follows that Fujitsu is unable to identify and produce

     Marine Drive messagestore data for 2 February 2004.


THE RELIABILITY OF ARQ DATA


26. The Inquiry has asked whether Fujitsu is aware of any cases where an ARQ log

     produced for the purpose of court proceedings against postmasters (i) may not

27. In the course of Fujitsu's investigations to date, a number of incidents that may

     have impacted either the underlying audit trail from which ARQ data is extracted

     or the ARQ extracts themselves have been identified. Fujitsu's investigations

     have included both document searches and discussions with relevant current

     employees. The incidents identified by Fujitsu to date are described in more

     detail below. Given the expansive period covered by the Inquiry's Requests, and

     the limitations of relying on and interpreting records of technical matters (some

     of which may be incomplete), without the benefit of guidance or explanation from

     relevant employees with contemporaneous knowledge, Fujitsu cannot be sure

     that the incidents contained in this corporate statement are exhaustive. To the

     extent that Fujitsu identifies further incidents relevant to the issue of ARQ

     Reliability after the date of this corporate statement, Fujitsu will inform the Inquiry

     as soon as possible. By way of summary, the incidents identified to date are as

     follows:

28. During its investigations to date, I understand that Fujitsu has identified

     approximately 2,400 ARQ requests dating from November 2002 onwards. For

     the reasons highlighted in paragraph 27 above, it has not been possible to

     conduct a forensic investigation into the ARQ Reliability of the audit data supplied

     to POL in response to each ARQ request.


29. The following summaries of incidents which Fujitsu has identified as having a

     potential impact on the issue of ARQ Reliability have been prepared from

     documents produced to the Inquiry. The incidents addressed in these summaries

     are not within my personal knowledge or recollection.


BROKEN AUDIT TRAIL


Background


30. In or around May 2001, it was identified that there was a data loss in the audit

     trail for a six-day period in August 2000 (the "Broken Audit Trail").18 At this time,

     audit data was gathered by an audit server and written to Digital Linear Tape

     ("DLT") tapes for long-term storage, to be retrieved when needed.19 There were

     two "Data Centres", located at Bootle and Wigan, which contained the main

     Horizon servers.20 Audit data could be accessed at audit workstations at either

     site or Fujitsu's Feltham HQ.21


31. According to PinICL PC0066318, which was opened on 24 May 2001, the Broken

     Audit Trail issue related to "[a]n incomplete TMS audit trail for the period 8th to

                                                                                          WITNO6650300




     14th August 2000 caused by coincidental DLT failure at both datacentres" in

     Bootle and Wigan.22 The problem was compounded when one of the tapes from

     the Wigan Data Centre was lost in transit while in the possession of a courier

     company, TNT Couriers ("TNT') on its way to Feltham for further analysis.23


32. As set out below, Fujitsu took various actions to mitigate the impact of the Broken

     Audit Trail, including:


          a.    Engaging with TNT regarding attempts to locate the tape from the

                Wigan Data Centre. Ultimately, neither Fujitsu nor TNT were able to

                locate the tape.24


          b.    Attempting to recover the data from the Bootle tape, with the

                assistance of third-party data recovery specialists, Vogon Data

                Recovery ("Vogon"). Vogon concluded that there was a flaw in the

                DLT media, and that recovery would only be 85% successful.25


          c.    Obtaining data from other archived sources. This was said to have

                reduced the break in the audit trail from 6 days to 1 day.26


          d.    Introducing automated media management and a "read after write"

                process to mitigate the risk of the problem re-occurring.27

Identification and notification of the Broken Audit Trail


33. According to a letter from Jan Holmes (Quality & Audit Manager, Fujitsu) to Sue

        Kinghorn (Consignia, later Royal Mail, Internal Audit) dated 23 May 2001, Fujitsu

        identified the Broken Audit Trail when undertaking an audit data extraction for

        Charles Leighton (Internal Crime Manager, POL), in relation to an ARQ request

        ("ARQ 8").28 It appears that data for the period 8 to 14 August (the "relevant

        period") was held on four DLT tapes.29 In order to retrieve the data, the tapes

        needed to be read by dedicated "Legato" equipment and software.30 Legato

        failed to read one of the tapes held at the Wigan Data Centre, and retrieval of the

        data from that tape therefore failed. The tape was dispatched via TNT to Fujitsu's

        Feltham offices for further investigation and, although track and trace facilities

        were employed, the tape was lost in transit.31


34. Fujitsu subsequently attempted to source the outstanding data from the

        corresponding DLT tape held at the Bootle Data Centre for the same period.

        Recovery was attempted internally and externally using Vogon, "a recognised

        industry expert in the field of data retrieval services".32 Vogon concluded that

        there was "a flaw in the DLT media and recover would only be 85% successful.

        This is no more than [Fujitsu] could do ourselves. ..A similar scenario would have

        been expected from the lost Wigan tape".33

35. The Broken Audit Trail was initially reported to POL as follows:


           a.     On 9 May 2001, Mr Leighton was notified that Fujitsu was unable to

                  source the evidential data requested.34


           b.     In a letter dated 23 May 2001, Mr J. Holmes informed Ms Kinghorn of

                  the issue and explained that "[t]he break has arisen due to a

                  combination of events outside [Fujitsu's] immediate control but it does

                  mean that we are not able to retrieve TMS records for that 6 day

                  period. All other elements of the audit trail are complete.35


           c.     Also on 23 May 2001, the issue was discussed by representatives of

                  Fujitsu and POL during a Contract Administration Meeting.36


36. According to the minutes of the 23 May 2001 Contract Administration Meeting,

     Keith Baines (Head of Commercial, POL) asked Colin Lenton-Smith

     (Commercial and Finance Director, Fujitsu) "if a Security impact on the loss of

     the data had been performed and what validation process for the tapes was in

     place ".37


37. Mr J. Holmes and Graham Hooper (Security Manager, Fujitsu) were the assigned

     Fujitsu Problem Managers for PiniCL PC0066318.38 On 24 May 2001, they

     prepared the following responses to the questions raised by Mr Baines at the 23

     May 2001 Contract Administration Meeting:39

         a.   In relation to the security impact of the data loss: "In the event that a

              third party obtained the necessary Legato equipment and software, it

              is evident from the fact that the tape could not be read on the

              dedicated equipment at the datacentres that any attempt by a third

              party to do the same would not prove fruitful. Specialist data recovery

              equipment is available primarily to forensic recovery experts such as

               Vogon International, to whom Pathway referred the corrupted Bootle

              tape for analysis. These companies operate strict controls to ensure

              that data recovery is attempted only for legitimate reasons. Assuming

              a third party succeeded where Fujitsu failed or managed to utilise

              other specialist recovery services, the information on the tape is not

              in a readily interpretable format and it is not possible to infer to what it

              relates."


         b.   In relation to data validation: "The validity of the data held, and

              subsequently retrieved, is proven through the generation of a

              ChecksumSeal at the time that the data is written to the DLT. This

               value is stored on a database, separate from the audit data, and

              subject to an entirely independent backup process. When data is

              retrieved from the DLT the Checksum Value is re-calculated and the

              result compared with the original value maintained in the database.

               The results are recorded in the database and these are checked as

              part of the Extraction process prior to despatch of data to PON. "


38. Mr Hooper notified Richard Benton (Problem Manager, POL) of the issue on 24

    May 2001 and recorded his summary of this conversation in PinICL PC0066318

        as follows: "I stressed that back-ups were taken and the problem resulted from a

        corruption of both tapes relevant to the period in question - a situation that could

        not reasonably have been foreseen. It is clear that Consignia's prime issue is in

        attempting to recover the lost data — primarily in respect of evidence to support

        potential prosecutions.... The cause of the read error on the Wigan tape is

        unknown and resulted in the decision to forward this to FELO1 for analysis (during

        which it was lost by TNT)...It was agreed that the only reasonable progression

        was to try and locate the lost Wigan tape so that an analysis and data recovery

        attempt could be performed. To this end I advised that I had been trying to get

        TNT to undertake a search but was not content that TNT were doing all they

        could to find the tape".40


39. The Broken Audit Trail issue was also reported in a Customer Service Monthly

        Report dated 30 May 2001.41 This report stated that "[t]he issue has been raised

        with the Customer and will be managed under normal problem management

        procedures. The requirement to undertake large data extractions continues to

        have a detrimental effect on the availability of the audit servers".


Attempts by Fujitsu to recover the lost audit data


Correspondence with TNT regarding the missing tape


40. In the first instance, as agreed during the call between Mr Hooper and Mr Benton

        on 24 May 2001, Fujitsu engaged with TNT in order to attempt to locate the lost

        Wigan tape. Accordingly, Mr Hooper wrote to TNT on 25 May 2011 requesting

        assistance with locating the package containing the missing tape.42 Fujitsu has

        not to date identified copies of the correspondence with TNT but is aware of their

        existence from the extracts recorded within the relevant PinICL.


41. TNT responded to this letter on 3 June 2001, "apologising for the loss and stating

        that there had been a discrepancy in the tracking system, which could have

        contributed to the problem".43 Mr Hooper reported in PinICL PC0066318 that he

        was "convinced that they are not trying hard enough to locate this package which

        must be somewhere in their system. / propose to respond and to ask that a

        search of all unaccounted-for items be made".44 In the meantime, Fujitsu advised

        POL that TNT was "no longer being used for the transport of media or other

        sensitive audit/security information".4s


42. On 20 June 2001, Mr Hooper again wrote to TNT "stressing the importance of

        finding the missing item and offering assistance in attending TNT sites to identify

        the package".46 When no response was received from TNT by 26 June 2001, a

        "[c]hase up letter" was sent.47


43. TNT responded on 13 August 2001, stating that "they have recently introduced

        a database of missing items, which can be searched against details of package

        contents."48 Following an "extensive check" of this database, TNT confirmed on

        23 August 2001 that the package containing the missing Wigan tape was not

        recorded on their system. TNT concluded that they had undertaken everything

     possible to locate the lost tape and apologised for "the difficulties this had caused

     Fujitsu and any other third party'.49


44. Following receipt of TNT's last letter, Mr Hooper reported in PinICL PC0066318

     that he was "now satisfied that there is no possibility of finding this tape. In any

     event it needs to be borne in mind that the tape in question was corrupt before

     despatch so the likelihood of data recovery from it was negligible".50


Rebuilding the audit trail


45. Fujitsu also explored the possibility of re-constituting the missing data in the audit

     archive using back up tapes from the Correspondence Server ("CS").51 This was

     discussed at a Joint Audit & Security Panel Meeting on 18 June 2001, attended

     by Mr Leighton and Gary Potts(PON Internal Audit, POL) on behalf of POL, and

     Mr J. Holmes and Mr Hooper on behalf of Fujitsu.52 According to the minutes of

     this meeting, Mr J. Holmes and Mr Hooper explained the background to the

     Broken Audit Trial and informed Mr Leighton that:


           a.    Fujitsu would be introducing a "read after write" procedure that would

                 provide assurance that data is not corrupt when written to tape.53 The

                 purpose of the "read after write" activity was to protect against the

                 accidental use of flawed media, but it would not guarantee that similar

                 problems would not occur in the future as it would only provide

                 assurance that the tape could be read at that moment in time.54

           b.    Fujitsu was also exploring the possibility of recovering the missing

                 data from Correspondence Server backup tapes.55


46. On 26 July 2001, Change Proposal ("CP") 3061, entitled "Rebuild broken Audit

     Trail due to Missing / Damaged tapes", was raised by Mr J. Holmes.56 The

     purpose of the CP was to reconstruct the Broken Audit Trail using some old

     messagestore backup tapes from the NON-Live rig and, subsequently, store the

     data in the audit archive.57 It was highlighted in the CP that, if it was not approved,

     Fujitsu would remain contractually non-compliant in the provision of the audit trail

     and unable to satisfy PON's requests for audit data in relation to the relevant

     period.58


47. CP 3061 was discussed by the Programme Change Control Board ("PCCB") on

     2 and 16 August 2001.59


48. Following this, CP 3061 was escalated to the Change Control Board ("CCB") on

     20 August 2001.60 During the CCB meeting, when asked how the Broken Audit

     Trail could be prevented from happening again in future, Mr Hooper informed the

     CCB that a read after write mechanism had been introduced to check the data,

     but "there was no way to guarantee that this won't happen again".61 CP 3061

     was approved by the CCB on 20 August 2001.62 However, it was reverted back

     to the PCCB on 18 October 2001 to consider an additional impact.63 On 25

     October 2001, the CCB noted the PCCB's decision to re-target CP 3061 for the

     C14 S10R release.64


49. By October 2001, the CS backup tapes had also been recovered from the

     relevant Data Centre and held in secure fire-safe storage, pending attempted

     retrieval of the data for the relevant period.65 In order to reconstitute the audit

     data from the CS backup tapes, a pseudo audit server was built which the backup

     tapes were to be loaded on to. As a result, by around 7 December 2001, Fujitsu

     had reportedly identified that approximately 66% of the missing data for the

     relevant period was available on the backup tapes.66 The remaining 34% was

     not present on the tapes and was deemed irretrievable.67 The gap in the audit

     trail was therefore said to have been reduced from a period of 6 days (7 to 14

     August 2001) to less than 24 hours (19:27pm on Sunday, 6 August 2000 until

     16:09pm on Monday, 7 August 2000).68


50. According to a report entitled "Audit Trail Break — Pathway Position" prepared by

     Mr Hooper, following identification of the available data on the CS backup tapes,

     Fujitsu's recommendation was to rebuild the audit trail using the CS backup tapes

     and provide POL with the available data for the period requested in ARQ 8.69 In

     accordance with the agreed retention periods in place at the time, the data held

     on the back up tapes was due to expire on 14 February 2002.70

51. By 7 January 2002, Fujitsu had briefed Consignia Internal Audit and Security

     Managers on the outcome of the data recovery activities." Consignia confirmed

     that the information requested by ARQ 8 was not, at that stage, required in

     support of a prosecution. It was agreed that Fujitsu would not need to retrieve

     the data from the CS backup tapes at that time but would take steps to ensure

     that the data relevant to ARQ 8 was stored and made available if requested.72


Audit of tape handling procedures


52. Although not solely relevant to the Broken Audit Trail, Fujitsu has disclosed

     correspondence relating to an audit that was conducted by Fujitsu, POL and

     Consignia of Fujitsu's management and operation at the Wigan and Bootle Data

     Centres. The audit also encompassed Fujitsu's Belfast Operations Centre,

     although Consignia did not participate in the audit visit to Belfast. The report of

     this audit does refer to the Broken Audit Trail issue.


53. In summary, a planned audit into the activities and operation of the Horizon Data

     Centres at Wigan and Bootle took place in October 2001 (the "Data Centre

     Audit").73 This also included an audit of the Operations Centre in Belfast, which

     was where much of the work carried out in relation to Data Centres was

     controlled at that time.74 It had been agreed at the Joint Security Audit meeting

     on 18 June 2001 that the Data Centre Audit would include tape-handling

     procedures and would be observed by a representative from POL, Rashpal

     Dhesi (Internal Audit, Consignia and later POL), to verify the tape-handling

     procedures in place.75


54. The Data Centre Audit was carried out by Mr J. Holmes, Mr Hooper, and Mark

     Ascot (Test Manager, Fujitsu) from Fujitsu, accompanied at Wigan and Bootle

     by Mr Dhesi. Fujitsu's findings from the Data Centre Audit were recorded in an

     internal report entitled "Audit of Horizon Data Centres and Belfast Operations

     Centre" dated 21 November 2001 (the "Data Centre Audit Report").76 This

     report set out a number of recommendations for the management of the Data

     Centres.77 A copy of the Data Centre Audit Report was provided to Mr Dhesi on

     27 November 2001.78


55. Mr Dhesi subsequently summarised the Data Centre Audit Report in the format

     of a Consignia note (the "Consignia Report") which he proposed to distribute to

     Mike Hannon (Horizon Contract and Commercial Manager, POL), Dave Miller

     (Managing Director Post Office Network, POL), Paul Rich (Group Managing

     Director, POL), Peter Corbett (Finance Director, POL), Vince Mulholland (Head

     of Corporate and Strategic Finance, POL), David Lewington (Head of Group

     Internal Audit, POL), and Ernst & Young (External Auditors).79 The Consignia

     Report and the extent of its distribution appears to have been a point of

     contention at that time. Whilst Fujitsu has not been able to find all relevant

     correspondence on this matter, Mr J. Holmes raised various concerns with Mr

Proposals to prevent re-occurrence of the Broken Audit Trail


56. The following measures were put in place by Fujitsu to mitigate the risk of the

     Broken Audit Trail re-occurring:


          a.     The "read after write" mechanism was introduced in September

                 2001.82


          b.     The Audit Panel was reintroduced to PON Internal Audit during June

                 2001 and expanded to include Security, to allow PON and Fujitsu

                 security and audit staff to deal with day-to-day issues in an informal

                 but professional manner.83


          c.     Automated Media Management (to automate tape labelling) was

                 scheduled to be introduced on 20 August 2001 "to minimise manual

                 tape intervention".84


          d.     In June 2001, Fujitsu proposed to introduce write failure checking on

                 archive tapes in order to provide some assurances that other Legato

                 tapes were not corrupted.85

57. Notwithstanding the above-mentioned measures, in a letter dated 7 August 2001,

     Mr Lenton-Smith informed Mr Baines that Fujitsu had advised PON Audit and

     Security Managers that "the measures to remove altogether the risk of future

     tape corruption can be achieved only by a complete re-design of the current

     solution" 86


58. Mr Baines responded to this letter on 29 August 2001, raising the following

     concerns:87


          a.     The "read after write" process only deals with part of the problem — a

                 more common fault with the media being used by Fujitsu is for the

                 data to become corrupt after the "write" process. "Normal working

                 practice we believe is to keep `parent, and `grandparent' copies of

                 tapes".88


          b.     Fujitsu "should have in place a process which alerts POCL of any

                 failure of their obligation to maintain a full audit trail'.89


          c.     Mr Baines also sought confirmation of whether there were any

                 alternative methods of extracting the data required to assist POL's

                 investigations and prosecutions.90


59. Mr Lenton-Smith sought to respond to these concerns in a letter dated 19

     September 2001, in which he confirmed that:91

                                                                                           WITNO6650300




          a.   The purpose of maintaining `parent' and `grandparent' copies of data

               is to ensure there is always more than one copy of an archive from

               which recovery can be attempted. In fact, two copies of the audit

               archive were maintained by Fujitsu (one copy at each Data Centre).


          b.   In relation to Mr Baines' request for a process to alert POL of any

               failure in the audit trail, Fujitsu was not in a position to know whether

               data could not be recovered from either of the two Data Centres until

               recovery was attempted. The reason for any delay in notifying POL of

               the Broken Audit Trail "was the result of our attempts to recover the

               situation without raising undue concern in POCL" and "[t]he

               unprecedented circumstances, including a protracted search by TNT

               for the lost tape, introduced greater delay'.


          c.   In relation to alternative methods of extracting the relevant data, Mr

               Lenton-Smith wrote that the audit archive "is fully secure, duplicated

               across two locations and contains special integrity features to provide

               assurances that data written to DL T, and subsequently retrieved, have

               not been amended during storage. It is considered the only source

               capable of being presented in Court and the only one that Pathway

               would be prepared to use in those circumstances".


Commercial resolution and closure of PinICL PCO066318


60. Issues surrounding the Broken Audit Trail gave rise to correspondence between

     POL and Fujitsu regarding alleged contractual breaches.

61. On 6 February 2002, Mr Baines replied to Mr Lenton-Smith's 19 September 2001

     letter alleging breaches by Fujitsu of "various obligations in the Codified

     Agreement... which give rise to the right to terminate, and there is a risk of future

     similar defaults because the root causes have not been identified and

     corrected".92 Mr Baines further wrote that "this incident and the issues arising

     from lost data represent significant risks to Post Office Limited's business. It

     compromises our ability to assure end to end financial integrity of our business".93


62. Mr Lenton-Smith replied to Mr Baines on 15 February 2002. In this letter, Mr

     Lenton-Smith denied that the lost data               incident demonstrated "poor

     implementation of the audit trail and failure by Fujitsu to exercise appropriate

     management control in carrying out the procedures for servicing audit trail

     requests. This is the only incident of its kind since provision of this service since

     the Summer of 1999."94 Mr Lenton-Smith further wrote that he "cannot accept

     that the incident and subsequent developments makes [sic] you believe that

     there is a significant risk to your business which in turn makes you question the

     fitness of Fujitsu's infrastructure to deliver financial services".95 In relation to the

     remediation steps that had been taken to prevent the Broken Audit Trail from

     reoccurring, Mr Lenton-Smith wrote that following the introduction of the "read

     after write" checks and tape cloning at both Data Centres, "there are two copies

     of all audit data at each centre...All audit DLTs are stored in the Data Centre

     line with recommendations for long-term storage of DLT media."96


63. Following further correspondence, POL and Fujitsu agreed to settle any claims

     regarding possible breaches by Fujitsu of its contractual obligations in return for

     a payment of £150,000.97 One of the conditions on which Fujitsu agreed to this

     settlement was the approval of CCN 1019 "documenting the necessary changes

     to be made to the Codified Agreement in respect of data storage".98 PinICL

     PC0066318 was closed on 6 November 2002 and CCN 1019 was approved on

     21 November 2002.99


OMISSIONS IN ARQ DATA CAUSED BY OPERATOR ERROR


64. In 2003, it was identified that data had been omitted from ARQ reports provided

     in response to three requests (ARQs 198, 199 and 200) relating to the Forest

     Gate branch received by Fujitsu on 23 July 2003 ("Forest Gate ARQs")and one

     request (ARQ 320) relating to the Urmston branch received on 1 December 2003

     (the "Urmston ARQ").


65. In response to the Forest Gate ARQs, ARQ data was provided to POL by

     Beatrice Neneh Lowther (IT Security Analyst, Fujitsu) on 29 August 2003.100 In

     September 2003, Ms Lowther provided a witness statement relating to the data

     provided. Ms Lowther explained that she had "access to reports that monitor

     faults, polling failures, equipment failures and calls for advice and guidance

      logged by the Horizon System Helpdesk. During the 01 October 2002 to 31

      January 2003, there were 13 calls from Forest Gate (FAD 100002) to the

      Helpdesk. None of these calls relate to faults which would have had an effect on

      the integrity of the information held on the system."101


66. Ms Lowther also provided an explanation of the process of extracting data in

      response to ARQs, including that "[i]noormation is presented in exactly the same

      way as the data held in the archive although it can be filtered depending upon

      the type of information requested". Ms Lowther further explained that

      "Extraction's [sic] are only made by authorised individuals" and are logged on the

      audit workstation and supported by documented ARQs.102


67. According to Ms Lowther's witness statement, she undertook extractions of data

      held on the Horizon system on various dates and at various times between 21

      August 2003 and 26 August 2003, in response to the Forest Gate ARQs. The

      resultant data was copied onto CDs and exhibited to her witness statement.103


68. Ms Lowther also extracted data in response to the Urmston ARQ. This was

      provided to POL on 8 December 2003.104


69. On 13 May 2004, Graham Ward (Casework Manager, POL) notified Fujitsu that

      Ms Lowther would be required to attend trial in relation to the Forest Gate ARQs

      during the week commencing 21 June 2004.105 However, as Ms Lowther was on

           GRO_____    during this period,106 POL's legal services team subsequently

      requested that an alternative witness statement was provided by Penelope Anne

      Thomas (IT Security Analyst, Fujitsu). Ms Thomas's witness statement was also

      to include "an explanation as to how days were omitted from the original data

      supplied'.107


70. Between 13 and 27 May 2004, Ms Thomas re-extracted the relevant ARQ data

      in response to the Forest Gate ARQs, copied this to a CD and submitted it to

      POL on 27 May 2004.108 Ms Thomas also provided an accompanying witness

      statement, dated 17 June 2004. In this witness statement, Ms Thomas stated

      that the CD provided on 27 May 2004 contained "additional transaction data to

      that which was originally supplied in August 2003".109 In March 2004, Fujitsu

      received the following ARQ requests: ARQ 455, 456, 457 458, 459 & 460 of

      0304. The requests noted that the witness statement prepared in response to the

      request should also "refer to previous data supplied iro. of ARQ's 320 & 321."110

      Ms Thomas therefore undertook a similar process in relation to the Urmston

      ARQ.


71.   Between 25 and 28 May 2004, William Leslie Mitchell (Security manager,

      Fujitsu) performed a comparison of the data extracted by Ms Lowther in 2003

      and by Ms Thomas in 2004 in response to the ARQ requests received in respect

      of the Forest Gate and Urmston branches.111 According to witness statements

      later provided by Mr Mitchell, the "recreation of the data and the check was due

      to Beatrice Neneh Lowther's absence [ _ _ _ GRO _ _ _ _ _ _ and the possibility of a

        witness being required to attend a planned court date." The comparison revealed

        a set of omissions in the data provided by Ms Lowther in 2003.112


72. In an email dated 1 June 2004, Mr Mitchell provided Mr Ward with an "update as

        to the root cause" of the omissions, as follows:


             a.     ARQs 198 and 200: These requests related to the period 14/10/2002

                    to 13/11/2002 (totalling 31 query days) and 12/12/2002 to 08/01/2003,

                    (28 query days) respectively. The root cause for the omission of data

                    from the August 2003 retrievals was "that the retrieval was executed

                    as a single task" resulting in the volume of data retrieved exceeding

                    the "available limit of the Message Store area on the Audit Server".

                    This caused the Audit Server to "randomly drop 11,135 data entries"

                    in relation to ARQ 198, affecting 10 query days. One query day was

                    affected by the same issue in relation to ARQ 200.


             b.     ARQ 199: This request related to the period 14/11/2002 to 11/12/2002

                    (28 query days). "The root cause for the omission of data from this

                    ARQ is when an ARQ is retrieved it is necessary to add additional

                    days to the end of the requested date span to ensure a full and

                    complete capture of the data which may have been harvested at

                    different times. The operator should then confirm that an end of day

                    log off is present and extract only the required data files. In this case

                    the operator added two additional days to each ARQ, which is

                    normally sufficient, but it appears did not confirm that an end of day

                    log off was present, consequently an additional 235 data entries were

                  not included in the data extraction.    The affected date was 27

                  November 2002 — Partial, no end of day'.


           c.     ARQ 320: "[t]he root cause for the omission of data from this ARQ was

                  the same as ARQ 199 and 200 above" . 113


73. Mr Mitchell also noted in the 1 June 2004 email that Fujitsu had conducted

     checks in relation to a number of other ARQs for 16 other branches "for which

     statements have been requested. No discrepancies have been found".114


74. Mr Mitchell provided a witness statement setting out the above-mentioned

     explanations in relation to the Urmston branch (dated 14 June 2004) and the

     Forest Gate branch (dated 17 June 2004).115 In these witness statements, Mr

     Mitchell concluded that the omissions made within the data provided by Ms

     Lowther had not been repeated in the ARQ data provided by Ms Thomas and

     that the latter data was complete in accordance with the original ARQ.116


2008 INCIDENTS RELATED TO RIPOSTE LOCK EVENT


Peak PC0152376


75. In or around December 2007, an incident was reported by a Post Office branch

     to the Network Business Support Centre ("NBSC") operated by POL. As

     recorded in Peak PC0152376 ("Peak PC0152376" ),117 the call was referred by

     the NBSC to Fujitsu. The NBSC informed Katrina Brooks (Helpdesk Support

     Technician, Fujitsu) that a "BM stock unit had a gain of £465.73"which "did not

     go to local suspense". When the stock unit rolled over, the local suspense was

     cleared and the gain was not accounted for. The value of the gain was shown on

     the trading position line on the branch's trading statement. According to Peak

     PC0152376, the trading position line "should always show zero".118


76. On 21 December 2007, David Seddon (Technical Support Product Specialist,

     Fujitsu) recorded in Peak PCO152376 that the incident was found to have been

     caused when two processes were run together: the rollover process on counter

     1 and various end of day ("EOD") processes running in the background. This

     caused a timeout, also known as a `Riposte lock' (the "Riposte EOD lock").119


77. On 2 January 2008, Gerald Barnes (Software Developer, Fujitsu) attributed the

     Riposte EOD lock to the EPOSS code, describing it as "not resilient to errors".

     Mr Barnes noted that the problem was identified to be caused by a fix made to

     the relevant EOD process (known as the "CABSProcess") as part of a previous

     Peak PC0140715,120 which caused CABSProcess to write out messages

     "atomically'.121 As I explain below, the Riposte EOD lock problem could affect

     the completeness of ARQ data, which raised potential implications for witness

     statements that Fujitsu employees had provided or would provide in relation to

     prosecutions brought by POL (the "2008 ARQ Issue"). This problem was found

     by the Post Office Account team (the "POA") investigating this matter at the time

     to have existed in Horizon's live estate between May 2007 and November

     2008.122

78. In January 2008, a fix for Peak PC0152376 was proposed; however, as noted in

      Peak PC0152376, it was decided that this would not be rolled out "given the rarity

      of the problem".123 According to an entry by Mr Seddon in Peak PC0152376, the

      need for a fix would be reviewed if the problem became more prevalent. In the

      meantime, a Known Error Log ("KEL") was created in relation to the problem

      ("KEL dsed5628Q").124 Mr Barnes provided input on KEL dsed5628Q, noting

      that the CABSProcess only ran on "node 1" (i.e. the first counter at the branch),

      and postmasters working after 7pm should use any counter other than the first

      counter.125 Peak PC0152376 was closed on 10 January 2008.


79. Peak PC0152421, a duplicate of Peak PC0152376, records that the branch was

      not "out of pocket' as the recorded loss was written off by POL. Further, a

      Business Incident Management System ("BIMS") report was issued to POL.126


Peaks PC0153009 and PC0152828


80. Two other Peaks were raised in early 2008 and contain references to

      PC0152376. It is unclear whether they relate to the Riposte EOD lock issue but

      they have been included in this statement for completeness.127 Peak PC0153009

      was raised in January 2008 and related to a Post Office branch with FAD 226242,

      where the postmaster was having difficulty with rolling over. The call was cloned

      (i.e., linked) to Peak PC0152828.128

81. The incident was discussed in an email chain by various members of POA team

      members, including Mr Barnes, Michael Peach (Software Support Centre

      ("SSC") Manager, Fujitsu) and Steve Parker (SSC Support Manager, Fujitsu).129

      Mr Barnes, who was assigned to the Peak, described the problem as the branch

      being unable to rollover a stock unit. Mr Barnes analysed the problem and found

      that it had been caused by one corrupt transaction. Mr Barnes proposed a

      general fix so that DataServer could correct corrupt transactions, though he

      noted that the frequency of the problem's occurrence would dictate whether the

      fix would be required130 Mr Barnes also recorded on the Peak that he was "not

      sure it is worth spending time improving the EPOSS version which is shortly to

      be replaced; it would be better spending the same effort making the HNGX

      version better. I had already requested that this be advised to the HNGX team in

      PC0152376".


82. As noted in Peak PC0152376, in this instance, Mr Barnes corrected the corrupt

      transaction at the affected branch by running a patched DataServer, and the

      Peak was closed later that month once the affected branch confirmed that they

      had rolled over successfully.131


Peak PCO155120


83. Peak PCO155120 was opened on 6 March 2008 after the NBSC informed Fujitsu

      that a Post Office branch with FAD 485611 had reported that the default stock

      unit (which usually rolled over automatically) had failed to roll over.132 Peak

      PC0155120 included a reference to KEL dsed5628Q and stated that it appeared

      the problem related to "a rare timing issue" where a software process ran at the

      same time as rolling over.133 An Operational Change Request ("OCR") was

      approved by Fujitsu to correct the problem and the Peak was subsequently

      closed.131 KEL kiangl823S was raised on 6 March 2008, which recorded the

      incident as effectively being "a specific instance of KEL dsed5628Q".135


Incident at the Craigpark branch (PC0158102)


84. In or around July 2008, it appears that there was an issue relating to a

      discrepancy at the Craigpark branch with FAD 141832. The issue was discussed

      at a Product & Branch Accounting workshop attended by POL and Fujitsu on

      1 August 2008.136 According to the "Actions" report from this meeting, Mike

      Stewart (Service Delivery Manager for On Line Services, Fujitsu) noted that a fix

      could be introduced, but "what is being proposed for the bug fix [...] if it were to

      go wrong could impact the whole estate so avoiding such a fix sounds like the

      correct decision". It appears from the Actions report that an associated BIMS

      report was issued to POL.


85. On the same day, 1 August 2008, Anne Chambers (SSC Systems Support

      Specialist, Fujitsu) emailed Gareth Jenkins (Distinguished Engineer, Fujitsu) and

      Mr Stewart regarding the incident at the Craigpark branch.137 In her email, Mrs

      Chambers explained that the incident caused a Riposte lock and that it had

      occurred once before at the same branch, but did not affect the branch balance

        on the earlier occasion. Mrs Chambers noted the underlying problem was known,

        citing Peak PC0152376. Mrs Chambers further explained that while there was a

        fix available, "given the low incidence of problems (and the errors introduced on

        the back of other fixes) it was decided not to implement'. However, Mrs

        Chambers suggested that "since [they] have no way of monitoring for it, and

        [receipts & payments] mismatches may not be reported by the [sub-postmaster],

        this decision should be reviewed".138


86. Mr Jenkins responded to Mrs Chambers on 4 August 2008 noting that he

        understood similar incidents would be flagged to Fujitsu through various

        processes, including generating a 'red event'.139 Mr Jenkins suggested it might

        be more practical for Fujitsu to carry out weekly manual checks for the issue, and

        that this "would be significantly less risky than a bug fix given the low number of

        occurrences." In particular, Mr Jenkins noted that he understood "what is being

        proposed for the bug fix and if it were to go wrong [it] could impact the whole

        estate so avoiding a fix sounds like the correct decision". However, given

        discussions that had taken place on 1 August 2008, Mr Jenkins explained that

        "we need to be able to re-assure POL that we would spot any further occurrences

        and have a mechanism to correct the accounts (if necessary) even if we don't fix

        the root cause".140


87. In a separate email chain, on 11 August 2008, Mr Jenkins notified Peter Sewell

        (Security Operations Manager, Fujitsu) of the issue at the Craigpark branch,

        stating "Given we only have a couple of instances, and a fix is as likely to cause

        further problems, then we're reluctant to make a change to Horizon. However, if

        Horizon data is being used in evidence for the prosecution of a Postmaster, it is

        probably wise to check to see if any such events were produced during the period

        in question. Is this something that can /should be built into the ARQ process7'.141


88. It appears that a meeting took place on 13 August 2008 attended by Mr Jenkins,

        Mr Sewell, Alan Holmes (Technical Design Authority, Fujitsu), Steven Meek

        (System Developer, Fujitsu) and Penelope Thomas (Security Analyst, Customer

        Services, Fujitsu) "to discuss the issue of errors produced by [R]iposte [...] in

        relation to the validity and integrity of data provided to [POL] under the ARQ

        agreement." Ms Thomas prepared a note of the meeting dated 14 August 2008

        ("13 August Meeting Note").142


89. According to the 13 August Meeting Note143, Mr Jenkins explained the issue as

        follows: "An EOD process (CABSProcess) was being run between 1900 and

        2000 hours, and at the same time the user was performing a balancing process

        on the gateway PC. During the EOD operation the CABSProcess created a 'lock'

        on the messagestore during which time (30 seconds) causing any other message

        writes to wait, subject to a 10 second timeout, until the lock was released. The

        balancing operation attempted to write messages to the messagestore but this

        operation timed out and the messages were discarded. Due to a deficiency in

        the implementation of the counter code the end user was not informed of the

        failure and the transaction (the balancing operation) appeared to complete

        successfully. When this type of error happens Riposte records an event to the

        event log. It was said that this type of error could happen with any type of

        transaction."


90. The 13 August Meeting Note recorded, inter alia, (i) a set of follow-up actions

        that were agreed during the meeting to understand the types of transactions that

        were subject to the 2008 ARQ Issue, and (ii) that Fujitsu "cannot provide any

        further ARQs until this exercise is complete as the audit server is being fully

        utilised retrieving the 5.5 years worth of Event log data. We must question

        whether it is advisable to provide further ARQ data or witness statements until

        we have a process in place to fully validate our returns. It was agreed that the

        process of retrieving all of the available Event logs would be carried out and this

        would start immediately."144


91. On 22 August 2008, Mr Stewart emailed Mr Jenkins and Mrs Chambers providing

        an update on his interactions with Shaun White (Branch Systems IT Advisor,

        POL) regarding the incident. In his email, Mr Stewart noted that Mr White was

        seeking further clarification of the causes of the Riposte EOD lock event at

        Craigpark to pass onto the POL Fraud team. On the same day, Mr Jenkins

        replied to Mr Stewart and noted that he and Roy Birkinshaw (Software and

        Solutions Development Manager, Fujitsu) would provide an update to Mr Stewart

        and Mrs Chambers in terms of communicating with POL.145


92. On 28 August 2008, Mr Birkinshaw circulated to Mr Jenkins and David Johns

        (Operations Manager, Fujitsu) a draft description of the Riposte EOD lock issue,

        which was purportedly targeted at the "initial goal of defining the problem for

         R&RMG management" and it was not intended for Post Office in its initial draft

         form.146 The document noted the following: "If the counter were to mis-handle a

         financial transaction, whilst simultaneously failing to write to the Riposte

         Message Store, this could have potentially serious implications on the integrity

         of the audit information supplied to Post Office."


93. On or around 3 September 2008, members of POA, including Mr Jenkins, Mrs

         Chambers, Mr Stewart and Mr Peach prepared an explanation of the incident at

         the Craigpark branch as requested by Mr White.147 The agreed draft explanation

         included the following: "We have identified two occurrences of this event in the

         last 2 years which have resulted in an accounting problem and the rest appear

         to be benign or had a minor effect which did not impact the branch accounts... We

         have a possible mitigation for the timing problem which has been identified.

         However, since there had only been 2 occurrences of the accounting problem in

         two years, it had been the decision of the Release Management Forum that the

         cost of implementing the mitigation would outweigh the potential benefit. This

         decision will be reviewed in the light of recent evidence as part of the normal

         process".


Investigation and remediation of the 2008 ARQ Issue


Fixing the Riposte EOD lock problem


94. By reference to various email correspondence, during September 2008, it

         appears it was decided that a fix should be issued in relation to the underlying

        software bug relating to the Riposte EOD lock.148 Mr Barnes, Mr Birkinshaw, John

        Burton (Programme Manager, Fujitsu), Mrs Chambers, Steve Evans (Systems

        Integration Team Leader, Fujitsu), Mr Jenkins, Mr Peach and Mr Seddon appear

        to have been involved in the decision and/or subsequent work that was

        undertaken to develop, prepare, test, and release a software code fix to the live

        estate (which was operating Legacy Horizon at the relevant time).149


95. As noted at paragraphs 75 to 79 of this statement, the Riposte EOD lock appears

        to have been first recorded in Peak PC0152376. Due to administrative reasons,

        however, related Peak PC0164429 was used as a means of delivering the

        software code fix.15o


96. As the software code fix involved changes to Horizon's live estate, the creation

        and implementation of the fix was decided as part of the release management

        process, and authorisation to release the fix was given on 29 September 2008.151


97. As noted in the relevant Release Note152 in or around October 2008, the

        software code fix was tested, and the fix was delivered to the Horizon live estate

        via release "T86" (Release number reference RNT8601).153


Review of the audit mechanism


98. In September 2008, the POA conducted a "review of the audit mechanism and

        of the Horizon counter's behaviour" (see, for example, FUJ00155253 and

      FUJ00155257).154 The review involved Peter Ambrose (Technical Manager,

      Fujitsu), Mr Birkinshaw, Mr Burton, Mrs Chambers, Andrew Dunks (Information

      Technology Security Analyst, Fujitsu), Mr Evans, Mr A. Holmes, Mr Jenkins, Mr

      Johns, Mr Meek, Mr Sewell and Ms Thomas. The review appears to have

      involved (i) an analysis of some of the branches and counters with high incidents

      of the Riposte EOD lock problem, (ii) identifying, inter a/ia, where the problems

      associated with the Riposte EOD lock did and did not occur, and (iii) the SSC

      checking ARQs to determine whether the Riposte EOD lock had resulted in any

      financial or operational impact on the branch for the time period relating to the

      ARQ.155 A working paper, titled "Analysis of Audit timeouts" appears to have been

      prepared as a result of the work undertaken as part of the review.156


99. In an email from Mrs Chambers to Ms Thomas dated 16 September 2008, Mrs

      Chambers explained that the Riposte EOD lock event would occur when one

      process had `locked' the Riposte messagestore and another process tried to

      access the messagestore at the same time.157 The CABSProcess, which would

      run at 7.00pm during the EOD procedures at the branch, was the "worst offender'

      for causing `locking' to occur; however, event locks could occur in other ways.158

      Whether or not the Riposte EOD lock event could cause a financial or operational

      impact depended on what the second process was attempting to do, and whether

      the process handled the error situation appropriately.159 Therefore, Mrs

      Chambers checked the ARQs provided by Ms Thomas to (i) identify the two

        processes involved, and (ii) assess whether the second process "could

        conceivably have failed to handle the situation, and if so would it have any

        financial or operational impact." It also appears that subsequent investigations

        into the Riposte EOD lock found that the "atomic transaction" that caused the

        CABSProcess to lock was not attempted in any other part of the EPOSS code.160


The change proposal for HNG-X


100. In or around October 2008, a change proposal was prepared in relation to HNG-

        X, which proposed the creation of an automated solution in HNG-X for the

        Riposte event log checks that were undertaken manually when ARQ requests

        were made by POL.161 It is understood that these manual checks of the Riposte

        event log were introduced as a result of the 2008 ARQ Issue. The change

        proposal was titled "Enable analysis of Horizon Counter event messages within

        the HNG-X Audit solution", and it was later given the reference number CP0336

        (also referred to as CP4867) ("CP0336"). CP0336 was also referred to as the

        "Counter Audit Change Proposal" or "Audit Strengthening Change Proposal".

        CP0336 was approved and implemented in or around July 2009, which is

        explained further at paragraph 116 of this statement.


101. CP0336 noted the "current horizon tactical solution" for retrieving archived data

        to respond to ARQ requests from POL was largely a manual process which was

        "error prone & time consuming', and that it required "local & insecure storage of

        event audit data, invalidating certain standards made within the current witness

        statement".162 It appears, CP0336 proposed a more automated solution be

      implemented in the HNG-X audit server and workstation applications to

      automatically retrieve and filter Horizon counter event log data when performing

      data retrievals in relation to branches operating Legacy Horizon or HNG-X. At

      the time, it also appears that those individuals involved in CP0336 considered

      that it was impracticable to introduce this change into the Legacy Horizon audit

      server given it was being replaced by HNG-X.163


102. CP0336 cited Peak PC0152376 as an example of the potential for the audit trail

      to contain instances of event messages which, in the event of an ARQ retrieval,

      needed to be analysed to understand if they were significant or not. CP0336

      introduced a change in HNG-X's audit retrieval tooling.


103. The changes proposed in CP0336 in relation to the audit system included

      amending the audit server and workstation applications to automatically retrieve

      and filter event data when performing branch data retrievals (i.e. ARQs) in

      relation to branches operating Legacy Horizon and HNG-X.164


104. Mr Birkinshaw, Mr A. Holmes, Mr Evans, Mr Jenkins, Mr Meek, Howard Pritchard

      (Principal Security Consultant, Fujitsu), Mr Sewell and Ms Thomas were involved

      in the initial drafting and/or discussions in relation to CP0336 (see, for example,

      FUJ00155271, FUJ00155278, FUJO0155373 and FUJ00155380).165

      service.166 It appears the persons involved in the initial drafting and discussions

      regarding CP0336 (noted above at paragraph 104) agreed that the proposed

      changes to the event checking process needed to be implemented.167 As a result,

      in December 2008, a PowerPoint presentation was prepared titled "Prosecution

      Support Urgent Issue" ("December 2008 Presentation")168, which appears to

      have been prepared in order to:


           a.    internally escalate the 2008 ARQ Issue and the concerns regarding

                 the completeness of the transaction data on Horizon's audit archive

                 that was being provided to POL as part of Fujitsu's prosecution

                 support service (i.e. as part of the ARQ process); and


           b.    support the sponsorship within Fujitsu of budget to fund the

                 developments summarised in CP0336.


106. It appears Ms Thomas prepared the December 2008 Presentation. Graham Allen

      (Application Development Manager, Fujitsu), Adam Cousins (Application

      Development Manager, Fujitsu), Mr Evans, David Hinde (Project Manager,

      Fujitsu), Mr A. Holmes, Mr Jenkins, Mr Pritchard and Mr Sewell also appear to

      have been involved or otherwise had sight of the December 2008 Presentation

      during its preparation.169


107. The December 2008 Presentation was presented to Steve Denham (Head of

      Service Management, Royal Mail Group Account, Fujitsu) at a meeting on 17

        December 2008.10 Mr Denham attended the meeting on behalf of Wendy

        Warham (Operations Director, Royal Mail Group Account, Fujitsu)."' Other

        attendees of the meeting appear to have included Mr Allen, Mr Cousins, Mr

        Evans, Mr A. Holmes, Mr Pritchard and Mr Sewell. 172


108. Following the meeting, it appears Mr Denham was going to speak with "Legal'

        about the 2008 ARQ Issue173; however, to date, Fujitsu has not identified any

        documents or records as to whether Mr Denham contacted Fujitsu's in-house

        legal team or external legal advisors, and if so, what was discussed.


109. In January 2009, the POA team prepared a revised draft of the "standard witness

        statement" that Fujitsu provided POL in relation to ARQ data. This contained

        proposed amendments in relation to the 2008 ARQ Issue ("Proposed Witness

        Statement") (see, for example, FUJ00122592, FUJ00122593, FUJ00122596

        and FUJ00122597).174 Mr Allen, Mrs Chambers, Mr Denham, Mr Evans, Mr A.

        Holmes, Mr Jenkins and Ms Thomas were primarily involved in drafting or

        reviewing the proposed amendments, which included adding (i) an explanation

        of the event checking process, and (ii) a description of the 2008 ARQ Issue.


Fujitsu's notification to POL


110. On 7 January 2009, Ms Warham notified Sue Lowther (Head of Information

        Security, POL) and David Gray (Chief Technical Architect, POL) about the 2008

        ARQ Issue via email175. In the email, Ms Warham provided a summary of the

     2008 ARQ Issue in similar terms to the description provided in the Proposed

     Witness Statement, and set out various steps that should be taken by Fujitsu and

     POL to address the issue, including:


          a.     checking the ARQs and confirming the data integrity in the period May

                 2007 to November 2008;


          b.     discussing and agreeing on how they disclose the 2008 ARQ Issue in

                 the witness statements provided by Fujitsu to POL;


          c.     identifying witness statements Fujitsu had previously supplied and

                 were still awaiting a court appearance to (i) confirm whether they were

                 impacted by the 2008 ARQ Issue, and (ii) recall and replace impacted

                 witness statements;


          d.     automating the messagestore alerts on the Horizon system so that

                 manual intervention was not required, with apparent reference to

                 CP0336; and


          e.     providing education to ensure that these types of incidents were

                 raised as a major incident so that the communication and

                 management of the incident was undertaken within relevant

                 timescales.


111. On 7 January 2009, Ms Thomas forwarded Ms Warham's email to Dave Posnett

     (Casework Manager, Investigation Team, POL), attaching the Proposed Witness

     Statement.16 Later that day, Mr Posnett emailed Ms Thomas, forwarding an

      email exchange between Mr Posnett and Rob Wilson (Head of Criminal Law

      Team, POL) regarding the 2008 ARQ Issue."' Referring Ms Thomas to his email

      exchange with Mr Wilson, Mr Posnett stated: "I would say Business As Usual re

      witness statements le don't include the two additional paragraphs on the last

      page. If any issues materialize in due course, we can address then - suggest the

      ARQs for these 4 cases are assessed first."


112. On 8 January 2009, Ms Thomas forwarded Mr Posnett's email of 7 January 2009

      to Ms Warham and Mr Denham (copying Mr Pritchard and Mr Sewell)."$

      Referring the email recipients to Mr Posnett's email, Ms Thomas noted that "POL

      clearly do not want the specific details of this incident included in the witness

      statement. I will hold off providing the 4 outstanding statements until our review

      is complete."


113. On 8 January 2009, it appears that relevant members of the POA also held a

      meeting where it was decided that POA would conduct a review to identify ARQs

      that may have been affected by the 2008 ARQ Issue (see, for example,

      FUJ00155402 and FUJ00155400).19 Mr Allen, Mr Barnes, Mrs Chambers, Mr

      Denham, Mr Evans, Mr A. Holmes, Mr Peach, Mr Pritchard, Ms Thomas and Ms

      Warham were primarily involved in this review, which included the following

      steps:


           a.   Fujitsu's audit team compared a list of ARQs prepared by the Security

                team with relevant event data limited to events occurring between 1

                May 2007 and 30 November 2008 that were logged between 7pm and

                     7.10pm, which were logged by counter one at the relevant branch18o

                     As a result of this work, 27 instances of the 2008 ARQ Issue were

                     identified181; and


              b.     the SSC then undertook further checks in relation to these 27

                     instances to confirm whether the Riposte EOD lock had impacted the

                     transactions or balancing carried out by the Post Office branch. To

                     undertake these checks, the SSC reviewed the SSC event archives,

                     Riposte messagestores, and Riposte event/transaction logs (where

                     these were available).182 Following these checks, it appears the SSC

                     concluded none of the 27 instances of the 2008 ARQ Issue identified

                     by the audit team had impacted the transactions or balancing carried

                     out at the relevant branches.183


114. On 4 February 2009, Ms Thomas emailed Mr Posnett184 and confirmed the

        following:


              a.     Fujitsu's checks in relation to the ARQs for the period 1 May 2007 to

                     30 November 2008 had been completed, which involved checking the

                     event logs in relation to 195 ARQs that fell within this timeframe;


              b.     27 instances of concern had been identified, which had been fully

                     analysed, and Fujitsu could confirm the locking issue had been

                  caused by "contention between the EOD process and a Riposte

                  checkpoint being written";


           c.     following the analysis of the 27 instances of concern, no transactions

                  or balancing activities carried out at the relevant branches had been

                  found to have been affected;


           d.     a change proposal had been raised to "automate the event checking

                  process", which appears to be a reference to CP0336; and


           e.     the "standard witness statement' had been reviewed and no reference

                  had been made to the "locking issue", but minor revisions had been

                  made.185


115. Mr Denham, Mr Pritchard and Mr Sewell were involved in drafting or otherwise

     had sight of Ms Thomas' email to Mr Posnett (see, for example,

     FUJ00155422).186


The implementation of CP0336


116. CP0336, which is described at paragraphs 104 to 108 above, was finalised and

     passed in March 2009. Mr Denham, Mr Hinde, Mr A. Holmes, Mr Sewell, Ms

     Warham and Guy Wilkerson (Commercial Director, Royal Mail Group Account,

     Fujitsu) appear to have been primarily involved in the preparation and approval

     of CP0336, which was raised on or around 26 February 2009 and approved

     internally by Fujitsu on or around 31 March 2009187. The changes referred to in

     CP0336 appear to have been implemented as part of HNG-X Release 2 in or

     around July 2009188, following a period of testing which involved teams at Fujitsu

     and POL189.


DUPLICATE TRANSACTIONS


117. The Inquiry has asked for details of the Duplicate Transactions incident, first

     identified in 2010. I also address apparent known recurrences of the incident in

     2014 and 2016.


2010 Incident


118. On 21 June 2010, Penny Thomas (Security Analyst, Fujitsu) raised Peak

     PCO200468 `Horizon Audit Spreadsheet Producing Duplicate Transactions' as

     an 'A priority', as she had identified duplicate transaction records in an ARQ

     return during an audit retrieval for branch 072128.190 The Peak was assigned to

     Gerald Barnes (Software Engineer, Fujitsu).


119. On 23 June 2010, Ms Thomas shared an initial report on the Peak with Graham

     Welsh (Application Services, Post Office Account, Fujitsu), Gaetan Van Achte

     (Service Director, Royal Mail Group Account, Fujitsu), Donna Munro (Security

     Operations Manager, Fujitsu), Peter Thompson (Head of Service Operations and

     Applications, Fujitsu), Gareth Jenkins (Applications Architect, Fujitsu) and Alan

     Holmes (Service Delivery Manager, Fujitsu).191 The report noted that under

     Legacy Horizon, duplicate records were held in the source Transaction

      Management Service ("TMS") file on the Audit server under "what was thought

      to be `exceptional circumstances";192 when the Audit application was in use,

      Riposte would not record duplicate messages in the reconstructed message

      store, and so transactions were not duplicated on the ARQ returns. However, the

      HNG-X application did not identify or discard duplicated records, resulting in the

      problem of duplicate transactions appearing in ARQ returns (Peak PCO200468).


120. Ms Thomas' report further stated that an analysis conducted the day before (22

      June 2010) had identified that one third of ARQ returns generated under the

      HNG-X application had duplicate transactions.193


121. Ms Thomas' report recorded that a discussion had taken place between Mr A.

      Holmes, Mr Jenkins and Ms Thomas. The various actions agreed during that

      discussion were:


           a.     To report Peaks PCO200468 and PC0194639 (see paragraph 123) to

                  Pat Lywood (Service Implementation Manager, Fujitsu) "to be

                  identified in CS Prayers as urgent'.194


           b.     As an interim measure, to incorporate the unique identifier NUM in

                  ARQs to identify duplicate transactions / unique sequence

                  numbers.195


           c.     Mr Jenkins was to draft a statement for management review detailing

                  the issue for transmission to POL.196

           d.     A separate issue was identified whereby a duplicated transaction had

                  a different `NUM', which Mr Jenkins agreed to review. 197 With respect

                  to this particular issue:


                      (i)     In an email of 23 June 2010, Mr Jenkins wrote to Ms

                              Thomas and Mr A. Holmes, "I've had a look at the Mails

                              duplicate. I think it/s OK. I've sent the extract to Richard

                              O'Neil in Crew to confirm that this is normal."198 In a

                              summary of the duplicate transaction issue he wrote "we

                              have identified scenarios with Postal services transactions

                              where (details tbs) which result in different transactions

                              appearing to be duplicates".199


                      (ii)    On 24 June 2010, Mr Jenkins emailed both again, "I've

                              now confirmed that the Mails duplicate is OK' and

                              amended the summary of the duplicate transaction issue:


                             "we have identified a scenario with Post Services

                              transactions where multiple, identical mails items are

                             accepted (ie the Quantity button is set to greater than 1),

                             but Postage Labels are printed for each individual item.

                              This results in separate transactions being generated for

                             each item, which are identical in the ARQ extracts (there is

122. The report also noted the need to identify the cases which had progressed to

        prosecution since HNG-X had been live, and whether duplicate records had been

        included in support evidence. The report references an initial review in which

        West Byfleet (R v Misra) and Porters Avenue (R v Hosi) had been identified.201


123. In an internal Fujitsu email chain on 23 June 2010, Ms Thomas reported Peak

        PCO200468 to Ms Lywood. In her email, Ms Thomas noted that the problem

        recorded in Peak PC200468 was a "very significant problem", and that "In a nut

        shell the HNG-X application is not removing duplicate transactions (which may

        have been recorded twice on the Audit Server) and they are appearing in the

        ARQ returns".202 She also noted that the steps taken following a previous Peak

        (PC0194639) were supposed to highlight any duplication of records, but this did

        not appear to be happening.203


124. Peak PCO194639 had been raised on 16 February 2010 by Andrew Mansfield

        (Audit Development, Fujitsu) as there had "been cases recently of HNG-X

        messages appearing in the audit files with duplicate JSNs (Journal Sequence

        Numbers— message numbers)" as a result of "an issue with the counter software"

        but not being reported clearly to the audit client user.204 A fix was attributed to

        the Peak "to highlight any problem with duplicate message numbers and make it

      obvious to the user".205 On 14 June 2010, the same fix was attributed to the Peak

      again. Documents relating to the underlying issue in Peak PC0194639 (i.e., the

      duplicate JSN issue) have been separately disclosed to the Inquiry.206 Copied in

      this email chain, Graham Allen (Applications Engineering Manager, Fujitsu)

      asked Mr A. Holmes, Adam Spurgeon (Data Centre Development Manager,

      Fujitsu), and Mr Mansfield whether there were fixes for the Peaks, and if not, how

      long it would be before they would be ready.207 With respect to Peak PCO200468,

      Mr Mansfield responded that Mr Barnes had started testing a fix to remove the

      duplicated messages from the Horizon transaction data.208 With respect to Peak

      PC0194639, he noted that the Peak was less serious as the purpose of the Peak

      was to clearly highlight where duplicates had been found.209 A fix would take two

      to three days and would require a change to workstation applications only.


125. On 24 June 2010, Ms Thomas updated various members of the Fujitsu team

      working on this issue with a more detailed analysis of the ARQs that had been

      affected by email. This analysis stated that:


           a.    112 ARQs had been affected;


           b.    17 ARQs highlighted one or two instances which indicated bona fide

                 activity;


           c.    7 ARQs were works in progress;

           d.     12 ARQs had been involved in two court cases;


           e.     8 ARQs had been involved in three court cases where witness

                  statements had been requested by POL, but not yet provided; and


           f.     Court activity was not known in relation to 76 ARQs.210


126. In the same email, Ms Thomas also provided an explanation of the problem and

      suggested a workaround that had been drafted by Mr Jenkins for POL.21 Mr

      Welsh responded that he saw no issue with the content of the report and was

      pleased to have a workaround.212


127. Guy Wilkerson (Commercial Director, Fujitsu) responded by asking whether the

      duplicated transactions would affect charges against Sub-Postmasters,213 and

      Mr Jenkins advised that "any detailed analysis of the finances of a Branch which

      is done with duplicate transactions without realising that there are duplicates (and

      so removing them) will give incorrect results" (including analysis of stock units,

      cash on hand analysis and possibly the sum of all transactions).214 Mr Wilkerson

      recommended that Alan D'Alvarez (Programme Director, Fujitsu) or Geoff Butts

      (HNG-X Release 1 Programme Manager, Fujitsu) of the HNG-X team look at the

      issue, and agreed with Ms Thomas that she should "hold off' advising her

      counterpart at POL of the issue `just until [they] get a chance to speak the HNG-

      X team tomorrow". 215

128. After Ms Thomas confirmed to Mr Butts and Mr Wilkerson that she would not

      communicate with POL regarding the issue, she expressed her assumption that

      any duplicate records presented to court would need to be replaced.216 Attached

      to her email was a list of ARQs and witness statements, highlighting the then

      ongoing cases relating to Porters Avenue (R. v Hosi) and West Byfleet (R. v

      Misra).217 Additional Post Office branches (High Wycombe, Kirkoswald, New

      Cheltenham, Castleton, Rinkfield, Shefford and Wokingham) were highlighted

      green with the note: "1 or 2 instances which indicates bone fide activity'.218


129. Mr Welsh forwarded Ms Thomas' email to Ms Lywood describing the problem to

      a wider Fujitsu team (including Mr D'Alvarez, Mr Allen, Mr Van Achte, Mr Butts,

      Mr Thompson, Mark Andrews (Account Manager, Fujitsu), Vince Cochrane

      (Head of Infrastructure and Migration, Royal Mail Group Account, Fujitsu), James

      Davidson (Operations Executive, Fujitsu), and Debbie Richardson (Programme

      Test Manager, Post Office Account, Fujitsu)).219 Mr Welsh wrote of the problem,

      "duplicate records that can not [sic] be differentiated are supplied as evidence.

      Thus could allow for legal challenge to the integrity of the system".220 Mr Allen

      copied Mr Jenkins into the email chain as he had "identified a workaround'.221

      Mr Jenkins responded that he was not sure whether the workaround would be

      acceptable to POL prior to review by the HNG-X team.222


130. Mr Wilkerson forwarded the email exchanges on the issue to Peter Beresford

      (Sourcing Manager, Fujitsu) (also on 25 June 2010), stating, "I don't want to be

      telling POL that they can't rely on Branch numbers or that there's a risk of more

      complaints from Post masters. They could regard this as a serious issue and

      delay acceptance on HNG-X. Geoff Butts tells me he's aware and that they are

      working on a permanent fix."223 Mr Butts forwarded this to David Cooke (Service

      Level Manager, Fujitsu) (with Mr Andrews, Mr Allen, Mr Welsh and Mr Jenkins in

      copy) warning, "this may become an Acceptance Incident' and explaining that

      Mr Jenkins was assessing the viability of the workaround but there was no

      capacity to include a fix within HNG-X Release 1.224 Mr Jenkins confirmed that

      the workaround would require Fujitsu to inform POL of the problem and "since

      this does relate to evidence used for prosecutions, [...J now we know there is an

      issue we do need to tell POL about it asap."225


131. On 30 June 2010, Ms Thomas emailed Sue Lowther (Head of Information

      Security, POL), Mark Dinsdale (Security Programme Manager, POL) and Jane

      Owen (Security Team Advisor, POL) informing them of the duplicate transaction

      records problem.226 She explained that with the upgrade from Legacy Horizon

      to HNG-X, the HNG-X data retrieval mechanism did not remove duplicated data

      in the ARQ extracts and, from a review of the ARQs provided to POL since the

      change to HNG-X, it had been indicated that approximately 35% of the ARQs

      might contain some duplicate data.227


132. Following a call with Mr Dinsdale, Ms Owen and Alan Simpson (Information

      Security Incident Senior, POL) on 2 July 2010, Ms Thomas forwarded notes of

      the call to the Fujitsu team (Tom Lillywhite (Principal Security Consultant,

      Fujitsu), Ms Munro, Mr Thompson, Mr Welsh and Mr Jenkins).228 The notes of

      the call confirmed that affected ARQs were used in the Porters Avenue and West

      Byfleet cases (R. v Hosi and R. v Misra).229 The notes state that ARQs had been

      provided to the defence expert in the cases, but there was uncertainty about

      whether the ARQs had been presented to the Court already, which may have

      necessitated the provision of replacement data.23o


133. On 1 July 2010, Mr Allen followed up with Mr Mansfield regarding the fix for Peak

      PCO200468.23      The Peak was with the Release Management Forum for

      approval and scheduling, as it was reported that Mr Barnes had produced a fix

      for HNG-X Release 1 which was ready to go.232 He had added an impact

      statement to the Peak, including a brief statement on testing.233 Mr Mansfield

      further noted that a possible workaround, being discussed by Ms Thomas and

      POL, involved "modifying the audit queries so that the message numbers are

      included in the output to the spreadsheets (currently they are not). This would

      allow the duplicate messages to be identified and removed by running a macro

      on the final spreadsheet generated by the application. "234


134. Ms Thomas asked Mr Welsh for his help with Peak PCO200468 on 5 July 2010

      as "POL have gone to POL legal for guidance and further returns have been

      identified this morning as bound for Court."235 Mr Welsh forwarded this request

      to Mr Butts and Sheila Bamber (Release Manager, Fujitsu) (copying Mr

      Lillywhite) asking for confirmation as to when the fix could be fitted, as "there are

      more court cases pending and whilst the Briefing to the Investigation has taken

      place they are coming back requesting help due to the level of activity and

      nervousness regarding the current work-a-round."236 Ms Bamber responded that

      it would take three days' work to take the fix with HNG-X Release 2.237 Mr

      Mansfield confirmed that Mr Barnes could merge the fix into the HNG-X Release

      2 code and deliver the fix by 7 July 2010.238 Chris Hammond (Major Release

      Manager, Fujitsu) confirmed this would be deployed on 10 July 2010 with all other

      HNG-X Request 2 baselines.139 On 7 July 2010, Mr Barnes emailed a wider

      Fujitsu team (Ms Bamber, Mr A. Holmes, Mr Mansfield, Mr Spurgeon, Peter

      Okely (Application Services, Fujitsu), Vijesh Pandya (Integration Team Leader,

      Fujitsu), Matthew Swain (Integration Team, Post Office Account, Fujitsu) and

      Nigel Taylor (Integration Team, Fujitsu)) stating that an Audit baseline for Peak

      PCO200468 was ready for build.240


135. On 7 July 2010, FSL and POL agreed to amend the standard FSL witness

      statement (the "Amended Standard Witness Statement") that accompanied

      ARQ data to include the wording: "the duplication of audited records has not, in

      any way, affected actual physical transactions recorded on any counter at any

      outlet. The duplication of records has occurred during the auditing process when

      records were in the process of being recorded purely for audit purposes from the

      correspondence servers to the audit servers.         It should be noted that this

      duplication of data in the audit stream has always been happening. However the

      Horizon retrieval process automatically discarded duplicate records before

      creating the ARQ spreadsheets, while the current HNG-X retrieval process for

      Horizon data does not do so".241


136. Ms Thomas and Mr Jenkins reviewed this updated language and shared it with

      Mr Lillywhite and Mr Wilkerson.242 POL had also suggested that Mr Jenkins

      complete the witness statement as the Fujitsu expert witness, to which Ms

      Thomas commented that this would not fit into the current service agreement and

      it would not be feasible for him to provide all witness statements going ahead.243

      Attached to her email was a standard witness statement including the modified

      wording regarding duplicate transactions,244 which had previously been reviewed

      by Mr Jenkins.245


137. In the 7 July 2010 email correspondence, POL also requested that Fujitsu

      "provide a witness statement to quantity the above that [they] could attach to

      each case (as appropriate), and treat each case where this is not accepted

      individually'.246 On 8 July 2010, Ms Thomas informed Mr Jenkins that she and

      Mr Wilkerson had discussed an "additional statement regarding duplicate

      records".247 Mr Wilkerson had initially suggested that Ms Thomas include the

      following statement in her witness statement: "The Audit Mechanism cannot alter

      the base information and therefore a re-running of the audit process will always

      produce the same result', which she incorporated in an updated pro forma

        witness statement.248 However, Ms Thomas noted to Mr Jenkins that that Mr

        Wilkerson was of the view that "if [POL] wanted an expert witness statement we

        should provide [sic]". In addition, Mr Wilkerson had "said that a CR would need

        to be raised by POL but when he realised it would only be for a short while and

        that we needed one pretty soon for Kirkoswald he thought] we could provide this

        FOC."249 Ms Thomas explained that if Mr Jenkins was happy to provide such a

        statement    (the   "Draft   Additional     Duplicate    Transactions      Witness

        Statement"), she would remove the extract Mr Wilkerson had proposed from the

        standard statement.25o


138. In addition to various drafting notes, the Amended Standard Witness Statement

        included the below wording, which explains that HNG-X did not de-duplicate

        records in ARQ extracts as Legacy Horizon had:251:


          "With Horizon counters, the mechanism by which Data is audited has always

          worked on the principle that it is acceptable to audit the same data more than

          once — in particular ifin doubt as to whether or not it has been previously audited

          successfully. The Mechanism used on Horizon to retrieve the audit data took

          this into account and only presented one instance of such duplicate data in the

          ARQ extracts. The Audit Mechanism cannot alter the base information and

          therefore a re-running of the audit process will always produce the same result.


          In January 2010 a new HNG-X application was introduced to filter transaction

          records for presentation to Post Office Limited. It has recently been noticed that

        this HNG-X retrieval mechanism does not remove such duplicates. An

        enhancement to the extraction toolset will be developed, tested and deployed

       and will remove such duplicate data in the future. However until this

        enhancement is deployed, there is a possibility that data is duplicated. The

       reliable way to identify a duplicate transaction is to use the <Num> attribute that

       is used to generate the unique sequence numbers. This will be included in all

        future transaction record returns until the retrieval mechanism is enhanced. A

       semi-automated process to copy the returned data, and then to identify and

       remove any duplicated records which may be present from this copy by using

        the <NUM> attribute, has been agreed with Post Office Limited for use in the

       interim period. It is emphasised that the duplication of audited records has not,

       in any way, affected actual physical transactions recorded on any counter at

       any outlet. The duplication of records has occurred during the auditing process

        when records were in the process of being recorded purely for audit purposes

        from the correspondence servers to the audit server."252


139. Later the same day (8 July 2010), Ms Thomas emailed Mr Jenkins that she had

      prepared a Draft Additional Duplicate Transactions Witness Statement for him,
      253
            to which he responded, "that looks fine and I would be happy to sign that if

      needed 254. The statement included the wording set out at paragraph 138 above.


140. In response to POL's email on 7 July 2010 agreeing to the amended witness

      statement wording and the introduction of the Draft Additional Duplicate

      Transactions Witness Statement, Ms Thomas emailed to POL a copy of the Draft

      Thomas forwarded this correspondence to John Longman (Security Advisor,

      POL), who responded that he was happy with the statement as "it confirms that

      [the duplicate transactions issue] has no affect [sic] on Horizon's accuracy. /

      have added an extra paragraph to tie it in with the trial of Seema Misra and

      confirm that only ARQ447 has any duplications within the disc you produced as

      PT/02."256 Ms Thomas forwarded Mr Longman's comment to Mr Jenkins with a

      revised copy of the Draft Additional Duplicate Transactions Witness

      Statement,257 noting that the additions made related directly to West Byfleet (R v

      Misra).258 Mr Jenkins responded "This look[s] fine. Do you want me to pop up

      and sign it with you as a witness?" and Ms Thomas confirmed that was okay.259

      On 15 July 2010, Ms Thomas replied to Mr Longman "we're happy with your

      addition" and arranged for postage of the signed Draft Additional Duplicate

      for help as ARQs for Caereithin FAD 166642 "appear to have duplications on

      certain months and from certain time in the day [sicJ'.262


143. On 20 May 2014, Jason Muir (Security Operations Analyst, Fujitsu) emailed Mr

      Barnes and Mr A. Holmes for advice as six ARQs he had run "returned duplicate

      data".263 Mr Barnes responded, "duplicates are OK for Horizon — sometimes

      multiple copies of the data were stored'.264


144. On 21 May 2014, Mr Muir asked Mr Barnes to prepare an explanation for Fujitsu

      to share with POL explaining the reason for duplicate data that had arisen in ARQ

      data sent and "alleviate any fears that may have arisen over the data".265 Mr Muir

      reported that the latest occurrence of this was in ARQ 051-056 Caereithin FAD

      166642 on 9 May 2014. Mr Barnes described the issue (with Mr Kay, Andy Dunks

      (Associate    Service    Manager,     Fujitsu),   Kumudu Amaratunga           (Security

      Operations Manager, Royal Mail Group Account, Fujitsu), Mr Spurgeon and

      Brain Lea (Software and Solution Developer, Post Office Account, Fujitsu) in

      copy) as being a problem with Riposte where transactions were occasionally

      duplicated in different files, adding "it is almost certain that all the other duplicates

      are identical too but to be thorough you should really check each and every

      one."266 He emphasised "The key point is duplicate identical transactions are a

      known issue which does not matter. However you need to confirm that you have

      not got duplicate transactions which are not identical because that would be a

      new issue of concern".267


145. Mr Kay asked Mr A. Holmes whether he had anything to add to Mr Barnes'

      statement, bearing in mind this would be reported to POL.268 Mr A. Holmes added

      more detail on the reason for duplicates: "Under old Horizon, Riposte Audit data

      was extracted from the correspondence servers (central transaction data

      repositories) by an agent harvester process. These were then written as flat files

      which were picked up and secured by the audit server. The design of this

      harvester was such that duplicate records were allowed to be included in the

      files. This would only happen in exception conditions and basically operated as

      a fail safe i.e. err on the side of including duplicates rather than potentially losing

      data. The design of this harvester, and the fact that duplicates may appear is

      described in a very old Horizon document: "High Level Design of Common

      Agents"AD/DES/042 §2".269


146. On 22 May 2014, Mr Kay replied to Ms Alexander's email of 19 May 2014, "we

      identified two files containing the duplicate transactions and confirmed that the

      first 4 duplicates and the last duplicate were all identical transactions. It is almost

      certain that all the other duplicates are identical too."270 He further included the

      explanations provided by Mr Barnes at 144, specifically that "the key point is

      duplicate identical transactions are a known issue that does not matter", and by

      Mr A. Holmes as outlined in 145 above.271

2016 Incidents

147. On 7 April 2016, Mr Dunks emailed Mr Barnes and Mr Muir (with Steve Goddard

      (Software Development Manager, Fujitsu) copied) noting that a duplicate was

      showing on a summary sheet, copied in the email.272 Mr Barnes responded, "it is

      something to be concerned about", and a Peak should be raised.273 He added "I

      am copying all the transaction files to the local disk of an audit workstation right

      now. I have already got on a USB stick two files which contain the first set of

      duplicates so that can be examined [...] I have studied the first message,

      5026965, in detail and it looks like the complete and same transaction is in both

      files."274


148. Mr Dunks raised Peak PCO250729 on 8 April 2016 with the comment "some of

      the data spread sheets that are generated via the audit retrieval process are

      showing a number of duplicates on the summary sheet'.275 The Peak was

      allocated to Mr Barnes who added "the reason for these duplicates needs to be

      identified before the prosecution team submits its spreadsheets".276 On 11 April

      2016, Mr Barnes investigated the `AUD' files generated on the 24 October 2015,

      and found they had gathered twice "due to an error in the process of migrating

      the share on which they lay from one platform to another".277 Peak PCO250729

      was closed on 26 April 2016 by Mr Muir with the comment "ARQ data sent to

      POL".278

149. On 14 July 2016 Farzin Denbali (Security Operations Analyst Post Office

        Account, Fujitsu) wrote to Mr A. Holmes, "as we discussed a few days ago, there

        are a large number of duplicate records in an ARQ output for FAD 173458" and

        asked him to investigate the issue.279 Mr Denbali also asked whether he could

        send the ARQ to POL, to which Mr A. Holmes replied "no, don't send the stuff to

        POL until we know what's going on."280 Later the same day (14 July 2016) Mr

        Denbali shared a file with Mr A. Holmes in an email chain entitled 'duplicate

        records in ARQ output'.281


150. On 14 July 2016, Mr Goddard forwarded Mr Dunks' email and the subsequent

        correspondence regarding duplicate transactions (document FUJ00172086) to

        Mr A. Holmes and noted "it turned out that the share on which they sat was

        migrated that day and the audit configuration file was modified by hand with two

        separate paths to the same migrated share which caused the files to be copied

        twice. It was incorrect procedure to modify the audit configuration files by

        hand."282 Mr A. Holmes forwarded the correspondence again, to Mr Denbali,

        adding "Farzin — your problem with duplicates in an ARQ is another occurrence

        of the problem detailed below', and asked Mr Dunks how the issue was "worked

        around last time".283 Mr Dunks could not remember and deferred to Mr Barnes,

        but Mr A. Holmes responded "there a couple of approaches we could take to

        work around this and get the ARQ completed, but I think that it/s better that we

        wait until Gerald comes back on Monday and check what we did last time so we

        can adopt a consistent approach. This problem is going to occur again for any

      to add this, and the eventual workaround, to your list of `problem cases' for

      reference the next time it crops up."284


151. On 15 July 2016, Mr Muir responded to the email chain attaching emails relating

      to the 2014 Incident.285 He wrote that the reason for the duplicate records in 2014

      appeared to be different to the reason for the 2016 duplicate records, but that

      Fujitsu "never highlighted the duplicates to them back in 2014 and I don't recall

      they ever queried it".286 While Mr Muir made this statement at the time, it is

      apparent from the contents of FUJO0176323 that Fujitsu did provide POL with an

      explanation as to the duplications in the 2014 Incident.287 Mr Muir suggested

      completing a check that had been suggested by Mr Barnes at the time of the

      2014 Incident, and confirm that the duplicate transactions were identical, as if

      they were not identical, this would be "a new issue of concern".288 Mr A. Holmes

      responded "the reason behind the 2014 duplicates will be different to this

      case."289


152. On 18 July 2016, Mr Barnes replied to Mr Dunks' email of 14 July 2016 asking

      him how the 2014 Incident had been resolved, "if you redo the queries as slow

      ARQs then you can produce the spreadsheets but with the duplicates listed. You

      then need a separate explanation to be [sent] to the Post Office as to why there

      are dupplicates [sic] in this case."290 Mr Muir replied, "far as we can see the

HISTORIC GAPS IN ARQ DATA


153. In preparing this corporate statement, Fujitsu has identified a small number of

      documents in relation to this topic that had not previously been disclosed to the

      Inquiry. These documents are exhibited to this statement.292


154. On 1 December 2021, Paul Gauntlett (Customer Solution Architect, Fujitsu)

      emailed Steven Browell (Chief Information Security Officer, Fujitsu), with other

      Fujitsu personnel in copy (namely Gerald Barnes (Software Engineer, Fujitsu),

      Manisha Mistry (Service Delivery Manager, Fujitsu) and Phil Boardman (Service

      Architect, Fujitsu)) regarding a "Historical Issue with Audit Data" (the "Historic

      ARQ Gaps Issue"). Mr Gauntlett explained that, during a meeting with John Nelis

      (Problem Manager, POL) and Dean Bessell (POL) the previous day, an issue

      was discussed regarding audit data gathered prior to 2010 existing only on one

      audit server and not both. Mr Gauntlett was asked to write up what was

      communicated to POL during this meeting, so POL could discuss this with their

      legal team. Mr Gauntlett prepared a draft write-up, in relation to which Mr

      Boardman, Mr Barnes and Mr Browell provided input.293 According to this write-
      up:294


            a.     Riposte was used in Legacy Horizon "to gather audit transactions from

                   all the Post Office counters... deployed in the Bootle & Wigan data

                   centres and on the Post Office counters... Each evening the Riposte

                    databases in each data centre were copied to the local Audit Archive

                   — this was done by the local Harvester...there were occasions when

                    the Harvester in one data centre would exhibit faults which would

                   interrupt the process of copying the transaction data to the Audit

                   Archive resulting in some data not being copied to the Audit Archive.

                    There is no recorded instance of both harvesters failing at the same.

                   Although data may be missing from one Audit Archive server, it will be

                   present on the other Audit Archive in the other data centre (and the

                   ARQ process checks for this            when retrieval requests are

                   processed)".295


              b.   Riposte was not deployed in the HNG-X solution, and the Wigan and

                   Bootle Data Centres were migrated to the IRE11 and IRE19 audit

                   servers. From 2010 onwards, "all transaction and non-transaction files

                   [were] gathered in IRE11 and harvested to the IRE11 Audit Archive

                   only. Live data is automatically mirrored to IRE19 — including to the

                   IRE19 Audit Archive. Under HNG-X, all audit files (transaction and

                   non-transaction) are consistent across both Audit Archive servers".


              c.    in terms of the potential impact of this issue on ARQ Reliability, "ARQ

                    queries are run against one of the AuditArchives. In the unlikely event

                    that the results show any gaps, the query is run against the other Audit

                   Archive to add the missing data and provide a holistic response to the

                    retrievals once a query has been executed against both Audit

                    Archives".


155. On the same day, Simon Oldnall (Horizon IT Director, POL) emailed Mr Browell

        noting that "[t]he PC/ team have flagged an issue to me around potential issues

        with the data integrity of the audit San. The initial feedback I'm hearing is that

        this is a historical issue, however this does raise a number of concerns". Mr

        Oldnall asked Mr Browell to provide Mr Bessell with a "more detailed brief on

        what the issues were, the history of these issues and any ongoing concerns that

        may exisf'.296


156. On 3 December 2021, Mr Browell circulated his working notes on the Historic

        Gaps Issue to a number of Fujitsu recipients, including Mr Barnes, Mr Gauntlett,

        Jason Muir (Information Security Manager, Fujitsu) and Geoff Baker (Information

        Security Manager, Enterprise & Cyber Security, EMEIA, Fujitsu). Mr Browell

        explained that ARQ retrievals can be run as a "Fast" retrieval or a "Slow" retrieval.

        The Slow ARQ process would look for and handle gaps in the sequencing of

        JSNs. The Fast ARQ process, in contrast, "will abort if the sequence of JSNs has

        gaps" (see CP 4867, FUJO0155474297). If the operator of the ARQ retrieval was

        alerted to gaps298:


             a.     In Legacy Horizon, "they should rerun the SLOW query against the

                    other archive as it is unlikely that BOTH archives will have gaps".


             b.     In HNG-X, "they should raise an Incident as this is not expected'.

             c.     In relation to both (a) and (b) above, Mr Browell's notes included a

                    comment that "[this relies on [the operator] deciding to do this and

                    could be subject to human error]'.


157. On 6 December 2002, Mr Browell sent an email to Fujitsu personnel including Mr

        Barnes, Mr Muir and Mr Gauntlett with the subject "CONFIDENTIAL - Audit

        Archive — The action plan299. According to this email, Fujitsu's investigation into

        potential gaps in the audit data included (i) confirming whether incomplete ARQ

        transaction responses have ever been sent to POL, and whether POL have

        always been aware of any such gaps, (ii) confirming whether there were any

        gaps in the audit data being stored by Fujitsu at that time, (iii) understanding how

        harvester issues were recorded/actioned, and if there were any current harvester

        issues that needed to be addressed, and (iv) confirming that Fujitsu is confident

        in the design of the HNG-X harvester.


158. Mr Browell provided Fujitsu's response to the Historic ARQ Gaps Issue on 11

        January 2022300 This included a summary of the issue in similar terms to

        paragraph 154 above. In relation to the ARQ process, Mr Browell's email stated:


             a.     "There have been a small number of suspected gap issues

                    investigated. It is understood that all investigations were resolved,

                    including by re-running the ARQ against the second data store

                    (Horizon) or by extending the date ranges (HNG-X) resulting in no

                    gaps in any ARQ responses."

             b.     "The ARQ process includes the adding of warnings for gaps in the

                    resulting files sent to POL. If there had been any gaps, POL would

                    have been made aware within the ARQ responses supplied."


             c.     "One known gap (for a specific FAD and date) was identified as part

                    of ARQ extracts performed against the Bootle archive. That gap is not

                    in the Wigan audit archive though. Therefore, Fujitsu is not aware of

                    any gaps in the audit archive data for Horizon when both archives are

                    used".


             d.     "There have been no gaps identified as part of any ARQ extracts

                    performed against the HNG-X audit archive".


159. Mr Oldnall responded to Mr Browell's email on 14 February 2022 seeking further

        information including (i) an explanation of the harvesting process and the

        parameters used when running ARQs, and (ii) an explanation of how gaps in the

        audit archives manifest in the ARQ data sent to POL and how they are brought

        to POL's attention.301 Mr Browell responded to these questions on 17 March

        2022, as follows:


             a.     As a general point, "In the unlikely event that there are gaps in the

                    Audit Archive, the ARQ process would spot it and if this could not be

                    reconciled by using the second Audit Archive store, POL would be

                    notified of the true gap found. POL would be aware of the gap".


             b.     In relation to the harvesting process, this "archives the data from

                    BRDB to flat files which are then stored in the Audit Archive. The

                method of doing this has changed over the years as data storage

                changed'.


          c.    In relation to the parameters used when running ARQs, these are "the

                provided FAD code and date range requested for the type of content

                requested (typically branch transaction and event data".


          d.    In relation to how gaps are identified and notified to POL, the

                application used to run the ARQ requests, AEClient, "checks the

                transaction sequence numbers which are the unique and sequential

                identifiers of transactions made at a branch. If any gaps in the

                sequence numbers are identified, this signals that there is a gap in the

                IRE11 audit archive data. The presence of a gap is presented to the

                operator...If this happens for pre HNG-X then the audit archive in

                IRE19 is checked. If that also shows a gap for the matching search

                criteria, then a true gap will have been found. If a true gap had been

                found, then the ARQ response spreadsheet would highlight this to

                POL".


OTHER POTENTIAL ISSUES RELATING TO ARQ DATA


160. In addition to the issues identified in this statement, I understand that Fujitsu

     disclosed to the Inquiry 102 documents from its Peak, PinICL and Known Error

     Log ("KEL") databases on 14 July 2023. These documents were identified by

     Fujitsu as records of incidents referring to the ARQ process in the context of court

     proceedings.

                                                                                           WITNO6650300




161. Many of the documents disclosed relate to system changes and support issues

      rather than issues with the ARQ data that was extracted and provided to POL.

      However, there are certain Peaks set out below that could be relevant to the

      issue of ARQ Reliability. In the time available, Fujitsu has not been able to

      investigate these Peaks in any detail but would be willing to do so if the Inquiry

      requests that it does.


           a.     PC0088573302 (Audit Data Extraction Problems) relates to a risk that

                  incorrect data may be used in an ARQ report for branches with two

                  leading zeros in their FAD codes.


           b.     PCO272681303 records that only "fast ARQs" can be reliably run in the

                  evening when the SQL server is shutdown. Running "slow ARQs" at

                  this time may give rise to unpredictable results.


           c.     PCO205806304 relates to duplicate transaction records not being

                  reported to POL in ARQ reports.


           d.     PCO206923305 relates to errors in the filtering process, meaning that

                  data was returned for one day less than the data range specified.

                  Fujitsu's prosecution support service stopped processing ARQs until

                  this was resolved.


           e.     PCO280793306 relates to issues experienced when running audit

                  queries for an entire month.

                  missing transactions on ARQ reports.


           h.     PCO211833309 relates to a number of ARQ returns which did not

                  identify transaction reversals.
