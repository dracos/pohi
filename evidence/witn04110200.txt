                       POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




       SECOND WITNESS STATEMENT OF JOHN GRAEME SIMPKINS



I, MR JOHN GRAEME SIMPKINS, will say as follows:


INTRODUCTION

1.    As noted in my first witness statement dated 4 August 2022, I am currently

      employed by Fujitsu Services Limited ("Fujitsu") as a Team Leader within the

      Software Support Centre for the Horizon IT System (the "SSC"), a position I

      have held since 2010.


2.    This second witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT

      Inquiry (the "Inquiry") with the matters put to Fujitsu in Rule 9 Requests dated

      16 June 2023 and 31 July 2023 (the "First Request" and "Second Request",

      respectively, and together the "Requests"), to the extent I have or had direct

      knowledge of such matters. Where I have referred to documents to assist my

      preparation of responses to the Requests, the URNs of the relevant documents

      are set out in this statement.


3.   I was assisted in preparing this statement by Morrison Foerster, the recognised

      legal representatives for Fujitsu in the Inquiry.

                                                                               WITNO4110200




ARQ DATA

4.   As part of the First Request, the Inquiry has provided Fujitsu with an ARQ

     Spreadsheet for the Marine Drive branch (Financial Accounts Division or "FAD"

     Code 213337) showing certain transactions and events dating from 2 February

     2004 (the "ARQ Spreadsheet", LCAS0001383 pages 17 and 18 only). I have

     now been made aware that the ARQ Spreadsheet forms part of a larger

     document. However, for the avoidance of doubt, in preparing this statement, I

     understand that the Inquiry requires me to consider pages 17 and 18 of

     LCAS0001383 only, and does not require me to consider the remaining pages

     of the document.


5.   By way of background for the Inquiry, the SSC does not use and has never

     generally used ARQ data in the course of its investigations. Instead, for

     example in the context of Legacy Horizon, the SSC referred to copies of the

     original Riposte messagestore for the relevant branch when investigating and

     diagnosing potential issues with the system. In this regard, the raw

     messagestore contained information additional to that in the filtered ARQ

     spreadsheets, and provided a much more comprehensive account of the data

     held in the audit archive.


6.   The messagestores used by the SSC were in an ascii format and consisted of

     long strings of text, which the SSC could then search and filter as necessary.

     Each string represented a Riposte Message in Riposte Attribute Grammar

     ("RAG") (as described further below) which is quite similar to the more modern

     JSON format. These extracted files were derived from binary files held on the

     correspondence servers or on the counters.




                                  Page 2 of 27
                                                                                       WITNO4110200
                                                                                     WITN04110200




7.    For security reasons, the SSC was (and continues to be) segregated from the

      audit function. The SSC therefore has no direct access to, (i) the audit data held

      in the data centres, (ii) the audit tools, or (iii) which files, logs, messagestore

      information etc. are collected for audit. Neither has the SSC ever supported the

      audit platform. It is for these reasons that I am not in a position to respond to

      the Inquiry's questions surrounding the reliability of the audit archive or of the

      ARQ data provided to Post Office Limited ("POL") over time.


8.    That being said, the headings set out in the ARQ Spreadsheet were familiar to

      me, as they appear to reflect sections of the messages recorded in the Riposte

      messagestore (albeit altered slightly in some instances). The ARQ

      Spreadsheet provided by the Inquiry appears to be in two parts, page 1 is a

      filtered extract containing the EPOSS event messages from the messagestore,

      and page 2 is a filtered list containing the transactions, also from the

      m essagestore.


9.    The messagestore itself is made up of Riposte messages. The style of the

      messages is called Riposte Attribute Grammar (also referred to as "RAG"). This

      is essentially a list of attribute names and their values. For example, "<Id:1>" is

      an attribute named "Id" with the value "1". However, these attributes could be

      nested, for example, <TxnData:<SessionId:44-186311-1-5858-1>>. In this

      instance, in order to refer to the Sessionld, you would use the notation

      "TxnData.Sessionld".


10.   In relation to HNG-X, the nearest analogy to the Riposte messagestore is the

      Branch database.

                                                                                         WITN04110200




11.   In the Second Request, the Inquiry has asked me to confirm whether, in my

      view, the ARQ data provided to POL in respect of proceedings against

      postmasters was sufficient to enable a postmaster to understand whether the

      system was operating correctly. As noted above, I have not generally referred

      to ARQ data as part of my role within the SSC and have no direct knowledge

      of what data was provided to POL for proceedings against postmasters. Neither

      do I have any understanding as to whether the ARQ Spreadsheet provided by

      the Inquiry contains information typical of ARQ data provided to POL.


12.   That being said, if I refer to the ARQ Spreadsheet by way of an example, my

      view is that the data provided in the ARQ Spreadsheet does not contain

      sufficient information for a postmaster to assess the health of the Horizon

      system at their branch. The ARQ Spreadsheet shows only those transactions

      recorded by the system. It shows that there were no receipts and payments

      mismatch within those transactions and that there were no system failures that

      required recovery. However, it does not demonstrate the health of the system

      beyond those parameters.


13.   The Inquiry has also asked whether the "sources" from which ARQ data was

      obtained would have been sufficient for a postmaster to understand whether

      the system was operating correctly. Due to my limited knowledge as to the files,

      data and events that feed into the audit system, both at the time of the ARQ

      Spreadsheet and to date, I am unable to comment.


14_   Beyond the data described above, it would also have been useful for the

      postmaster to have visibility of (i) the opening figures from the last rollover, (ii) a

      running total of the sales, and (iii) the daily cash and stamp declarations made


                                      Page 4 of 27
                                                                                     WI TN04110200
                                                                                 WITNO4110200




      by the postmaster. Access to these records would have allowed the postmaster

      to compare the Horizon generated figures against the declarations made by the

      postmaster from the point of the last rollover. A comparison of these figures

      would show the point at which the two figures diverged, allowing the postmaster

      to then check what was happening at the branch at that point in time.


ARQ SPREADSHEET HEADINGS

15.   The Inquiry has asked Fujitsu to explain the various headings in the ARQ

      Spreadsheet, including a breakdown of the structure of the SessionlD and

      TxnID fields. Notwithstanding the limitations set out at paragraph 5 above, an

      explanation of each of the headings of the ARQ Spreadsheet is set out below.

      These explanations have been assisted in part by reference to the document

      entitled "TPS Object Model" and dated 19 August 1999 ("TD/DES/013",

      FUJ00171947). These explanations start first with page 2 of the ARQ

      Spreadsheet (namely, the list of transactions).


16.   Column A — "ID": See TD/DES/013, section 3.3: Id, "Counter position number".

      The numbers for these counter positions are as follows:

          Value                               Meaning

      1            Gateway Counter (i.e. the counter which communicates with the
                   datacentres on behalf of the branch)
      2 to 30      The counter range of node IDs
      31           The mirror messagestore. This is only used when a branch has
                   a single counter position. It acts as a Riposte neighbour to
                   create a duplicate copy of the messagestore on counter 1.

                   Without this if the hard disk on counter 1 failed, any messages
                   that had not been replicated to the datacentre would have been
                   lost.

        Value                                   Meaning

17.   Column B — User: See TD/DES/013, section 3.3: User, "Clerk/employee as

      Riposte use►".


18.   Column C — SU: See TD/DES/013, section 3.4: Container, "Stock unit name".

      By way of background, there are two types of stock unit, (i) individual, which is

      attributable to a single user at any one time, and (ii) shared, where more than

      one user can use the stock unit at the same time. The way in which stock units

      in Legacy Horizon were configured was determined by each postmaster on a

      branch-by-branch basis.


19.   Column D — Date:


      19.1   The explanation of this field could be drawn from several sources, as

             noted below.


               19.1.1 See TD/DES/013, section 3.3: Date, "The date the message is

                       written to the journal, format (DD-Mon-YYYY)"; or

                                                                                             WITNO4110200
                                                                                          WITNO4110200




             19.1.2 See TD/DES/013, section 3.4: Start Date, "Date the transaction

                      commenced' (note that the attribute hierarchy, as explained at

                      paragraph 9 above, is TxnData.Start.Date); or


             19.1.3 See TD/DES/013, section 3.4: End Date, "Date the transaction

                      completed' (note that the attribute hierarchy, as explained at

                      paragraph 9 above, is TxnData.End.Date).


      19.2   Initially, I thought that this field would have been the first option in this list

             (i.e. the "Date" field). However, due to the confusing timeline for the

             transferred session (see SessionlD 44-213337-1-899855-1), it now

             appears that this field is probably the transaction "Start Date". Given that

             all the transactions provided in the ARQ Spreadsheet are for the same

             date, the choice of "Date" field attribute should not affect the

             interpretation of the ARQ Spreadsheet. It is, however, important for the

             time element below. A member of the Fujitsu audit team should be able

             to confirm the position.


20.   Column E — Time:


      20.1 As with the "Date" field above, the explanation of this field could be drawn

             from several sources, as noted below.


             20.1.1 See TD/DES/013, section 3.3: Time, "The time the message is

                      written to the journal, format (HH:MM:SS)". Unless specified, I

                      believe that this was in UTC.




                                      Page 7 of 27
                                                                                 WITNO4110200
                                                                               WITNO4110200




       20.1.2 See TD/DES/013, section 3.4: Start Time, "Time the transaction

               commenced' (note the attribute hierarchy, as explained at

               paragraph 9 above, is TxnData.Start.Time)


       20.1.3 See TD/DES/013, section 3.4: End Time, "Time the transaction

               completed' (note the attribute hierarchy, as explained at

               paragraph 9 above, is TxnData.Start.Time)


20.2   In line with the "Date" field above, it appears that the "Time" field in the

       ARQ Spreadsheet is likely to be the transaction "Start Time". This makes

       most sense when looking at the ARQ Spreadsheet as, using the "Start

       Time" field, the time allocated to the transactions would be the time they

       were added to the basket, as opposed to the time they were settled and

       committed to the messagestore (someone from Fujitsu's audit team

       should be able to confirm the position). By way of explanation, "settled"

       is a term used when the transactions in a basket are settled to a payment

       type e.g. cash, card or cheque. This is normally the last thing to happen

       when a basket is completed and journalised (i.e. recorded in the

       messagestore).


20.3 The use of the "Start Time" field (if my interpretation is correct) means

       that the transactions appear to jump back and forth between the

       counters, when in fact I believe the user only moved once. This may

       initially give the impression that there were concurrent logins by the user,

       when in fact it appears that there was no concurrent login in this instance

       (see further explanation below).

21.   Column F — Sessionid: See TD/DES/013, section 3.4: Session Id, "Unique

      session identifier for all transactions within a customer session. Contains

      Groupid, Id and Num separated by hyphens of the messages (normally the first)

      within the session"


      21.1 By way of background, a session is generated by Riposte when a new

             basket is opened and closes when the basket is settled. Cancelbd

             sessions would not generally appear in the messagestore.


      21.2   In order to assist the Inquiry, set out on the next page is an example

             session from the ARQ spreadsheet. An explanation of the example is

             then provided on the following page.

21.3   Using Session "44-213337-1-899855-1" as an example, this has 15

       transactions in the session; 14 transactions that are coming into the

       branch, these were all product 184 (Grp13 Retirement Pension), and one

       transaction is going out of the branch. This was the settlement to product

       1 (Cash). All these transactions can be seen to belong to the same

       session, as they all have the same session number. The session can be

       seen to total to zero value as expected. Further detail in relation to the

       Product field is provided below.


21.4   In this example, the session number is created by:


       21.4.1 44: I believe this stands for the UK.


       21.4.2 213337: The numeric version of the FAD (Financial Accounts

               Division) code (excluding the check digit).


       21.4.3 1: The counter position ("Id") that the session was created on.


       21.4.4 899855: A current messagestore "Num" to ensure that the

               Session number is unique. This appears to be the "Num" of when

               the previous Session completed, but that is just from

               observation. By way of background, "Num" is a consecutive

               number to ensure that each message is uniquely identifiable.


       21.4.5 1: I am unsure what this is generated by. The value for this field

               is usually one but may be more. However, once generated the

               value stays the same for the Session.

22.   Column G — Txnld: From TD/DES/013 section 3.4: Txn Id, "Unique transaction

      identifier for all messages within a customer transaction. Contains Groupld, Id

      and Num separated by hyphens of the messages (normally the first) within the

      transaction".


      22.1 Using the same example above, the first transaction has a Txnld of "44-

            213337-1-899855-2". This is very similar to the Sessionld. The

            construction is:


             22.1.1 44: 1 believe this stands for the UK.


             22.1.2 213337: As above, this is the numeric version of the FAD code

                      (excluding the check digit).


             22.1.3 1: The counter position ("Id") where the transaction was added

                      to the basket.


             22.1.4 899855: This is normally the same as the Sessionld (but not

                      always, as can be seen by the settlement transaction).


             22.1.5 2: This usually starts at 1 and increases by increments of 1 for

                      each transaction added to the Session. There may be gaps in

                      the numbering (as in this case), for example, where transactions

                      are added and removed. There may also be duplicates where

                      products are linked (see for example Txnld 44-213337-1-

                      899920-3 which was for Products 260 "Transcash Giro" and 121

                      "Giro Transcash Fee")

      I understand from Morrison Foerster and the legal team at Fujitsu that the

      messagestore from which the ARQ Spreadsheet was derived is no longer

      standard practice for trading, stock held at the branch was treated as a liability

      and was therefore reflected as a negative value_ To that extent, stock being

31.   Column P — Foreignlndicator: Foreign encashment related to the payment of

      benefits, particularly child benefits. In this regard, each benefits claimant had a

      "nominated" branch, which was the default branch where they would go to

      collect their benefit payments. If a benefits claimant attended a different branch

      to collect a payment, the system would go online to look up the relevant details.

      This was classified as a "foreign" encashment and took slightly longer than a

      payment at the claimant's nominated branch.


      31.1 TD/DES/013 does not discuss this message attribute directly but does

             discuss its usage in the Oracle database (section 4.12 and 4.13) as the

             database field "not foreign". This has somewhat reversed the logic, but

             my understanding would be that this attribute value in the messagestore

             and any derived ARQ data would be "0" when the transaction is at the

             nominated branch and "1" when it is a foreign encashment.


      31.2   For completeness, the messagestore field this is derived from is:

             EPOSSTransaction.BlackBoxData.ForeignIndicator.

32.   In relation to the additional attributes in the event log page of the ARQ

      Spreadsheet:


      32.1 EPOSSTransaction.Ti is a high-level descriptor of the event (e.g. that a

             report was printed); and


      32.2   EPOSSTransaction.T provides further details of the event (e.g. the type

             of report that was printed).


SIMULTANEOUS LOG-INS

33.   The Inquiry has asked Fujitsu to explain, both in the context of Legacy Horizon

      and HNG-X, whether it is possible for a postmaster to be logged on to more

      than one node (or "counter") simultaneously, using the same User ID. The

      Inquiry has asked for the ARQ Spreadsheet to be used as an example in this

      regard.


34.   Although there have been various issues with concurrent logins over time

      (some of which are discussed in this statement), an initial observation is that

      the ARQ Spreadsheet for this particular instance does not appear to contain

      evidence that a user was logged onto two counters simultaneously. Instead, the

      data contained in this ARQ Spreadsheet appears to show that the user made

      use of the "Session Transfer" and "Suspend Session" functions that were

      available in Legacy Horizon (as explained in more detail below). In order to

      determine more conclusively what happened at the branch, access to the raw

      messagestore would be required.


35.   However, in response to the Inquiry's First Request, I set out below my

      understanding of simultaneous logins in both Legacy Horizon and HNG-X.

                                                                                     WITN04110200




      Legacy Horizon:


36.   The "Session Transfer" facility allowed the current user session to be

      transferred from one counter to a second counter. For example, if whilst logged

      into Counter 1, the same user logs into Counter 2, the application would send

      all transactional information for current active and/or suspended sessions from

      Counter 1 to Counter 2 and then log the user out of the original counter (the

      document entitled 'EPOSS Transaction Service - High Level Design'

      (EP/DES/022) dated 27 July 2000 (FUJ00171948), may be of interest to the

      Inquiry in this regard). This is the facility that appears to have been used by the

      user in this ARQ Spreadsheet, as illustrated in my analysis of the transactions

      in Appendix 1 to this statement.


37.   Early in the life of Legacy Horizon (pre-rollout), a user could have a concurrent

      login by performing a Session Transfer whilst the originating counter was very

      busy, for example generating a large report. However, from PinICL PCO011992

      raised on 12 June 1998 (FUJO0112120), I can see that the "StopDeskTransfer"

      module was introduced in around January 1999 as a more robust way of

      notifying the system when not to transfer a session. The StopDeskTransfer

      service is described in more detail in section 2.4 of the document entitled'High

      Level Design of Common Agents' (AD/DES/042) and dated 27 May 2003

      (FUJ00171949). However, Peak PCO065075 raised on 18 April 2001

      (FUJ00171950) indicates that providers of the Riposte software, Escher, fixed

      the issues that the StopDeskTransfer module was intended to address and,

      from April 2001, the module was no longer required.

                                                                                     WITN04110200




38.   That being said, if the counters were not communicating with one another inside

      the branch (not to be confused with communication to the data centre), then

      there was still the potential for a user to be logged on to two counters. This is

      expressed in PinICL PCO061801 raised on 30 January 2001 (FUJ00171951)

      which notes that "[h]aving looked at the problem it seems that, due to excess

      network activity, the two counters were not in communication with each other

      and were therefore seemingly disconnected. In this circumstance, the desktop

      will time out and allow the login so that users can log in after a counter crash."


39.   Although I do not recall being aware at the relevant time, during the course of

      the Bates & Ors v POL Group Litigation (the "Group Litigation"), I became

      aware of defects in the system that allowed concurrent logon. This work

      identified the following two Peaks:


      39.1 PCO027581 (raised on 9 July 1999, FUJ00075563): This Peak showed

             that a user could logon to two counters simultaneously, but this was not

             regarded as a defect by Esher. In fact, it had been discussed before in

             PinICL PCO013495 (FUJ00109810), where it was viewed as a breach of

             the Access Control Policy, as to log into more than one counter

             simultaneously would require the user to share their logon details.


      39.2   PC0051327 (raised on 28 July 2000, FUJ00072297): A session transfer

             occurred whilst the user was rolling the stock unit. The transfer failed but

             the user was still logged on to the second counter. This was during the

             introduction of the StopDeskTransfer and the EPOSS code was not yet

             using the newer functionality. This was fixed when the next version of

             EPOSS was released that used the StopDeskTransfer functionality.

                                                                                   WITNO4110200




      HNG-X:

40.   Initially, concurrent log ins were not possible in HNG-X. The user would get a

      warning about a concurrent logon noting that, if they continued the original

      session, they would be disconnected. However, that changed with the

      introduction of EUM, part of "Enhanced User Management".


41.   Now, following the introduction of EUM, there is one internal Post Office ID

      ("POID") for each user across the entire estate. Each user is then able to have

      multiple Horizon User IDs ("HUID"). These HUIDs allow the user to work on

      multiple counters in the same branch at any one time. That being said, ifa user

      does log into a second counter, the first counterwould have to be locked whilst

      the session on the second counter is taking place. The user can then return to

      the first counter to complete their original session.


42.   I refer in this regard to the document entitled 'HNG-X Counter Application High

      Level Design' (DES/APP/HLD/0047) and dated 8 June 2023 (FUJ00171952),

      which states at 7.15 (Lock Counter), '[a]s part of changes for CP2144 (EUM

      Concurrent    Login),   the    existing   `Lock'   button   is   separated   from

      Suspend/Resume button and included as new Button (shortcut — T3) on the

      right hand command bar. CP2144 provides the ability to logon to multiple

      Counters with a single POID and one or more HUIDs. The major restriction on

      this concurrent logon ability is that only one Counter may be active at any one

      point in time while the other Counters must be locked..."

TIMESTAMPS IN THE AUDIT DATA

43.   The Inquiry has asked Fujitsu to explain, both in the context of Legacy Horizon

      and HNG-X, how timestamps are recorded and synchronised. These are

      addressed in turn below:


      Legacy Horizon:

44.   The timestamps recorded in Legacy Horizon were from the local counter time.

      However, there was a time service ("NTP") running at the correspondence

      layer, and the counters would synchronise their local time to these servers via

      the Riposte Service. A Windows event would be generated when this

      happened. I exhibit Peaks PC0070702 (raised on 15 October 2001,

      FUJ00171953) and PC0074043 (raised on 20 February 2002, FUJ00171954)

      to this statement in this regard.


45.   From PC0053384 raised on 1 September 2000 (FUJ00075159), it appears that

      the initial rollout of Legacy Horizon allowed a maximum of one second drift

      before a Windows event was generated, which was increased to five seconds

      due to an issue with ISDN delay. This Peak also mentions that this change

      would be captured in version 0.5 of the document entitled `Riposte 6 Message

      Server Configuration for Counters' (TD/SPE/010) which is dated 8 August 2000

      (FUJ00171955). I do not believe there to have been any real practical impact

      from this change. It just meant that there were no continuous time corrections

      happening anymore.


      HNG-X:

46.   There are multiple date / time elements in the transaction tables in the Branch

      Database, some of these elements are completed by the counter, some are



                                    Page 21 of 27

                                                                                   WITN04110200




      completed by the BAL and others are completed by the Branch Database. I

      defer to the subject matter experts in this regard, most likely to be Architects

      with specialist knowledge.


47.   In relation to this aspect of the Inquiry's First Request, I note that Fujitsu no

      longer controls the counter hardware or operation including the NTP service,

      which are now managed by DXC.


OFFLINE TRANSACTIONS

48_   The Inquiry has asked, both in the context of Legacy Horizon and HNG-X, what

      the expected reporting would be in the "log files" when transactions have taken

      place offline (i.e., when the counter is not connected to the datacentre). For

      Legacy Horizon, I have interpreted the term "log files" to mean the Riposte

      messagestore discussed above. Although network connectivity issues do not

      generally fall within the remit of the SSC, I set out below my understanding of

      the position based on knowledge I have gained during my time on the Post

      Office Account at Fujitsu.


      Legacy Horizon:

49.   Legacy Horizon was designed to function predominantly offline. Transactions

      conducted offline in Legacy Horizon would therefore appear exactly the same

      as those conducted online. Any transactions that had online requirements

      would fail if a user attempted to conduct them offline.


50.   In terms of the user's view when conducting transactions offline, I understand

      that, after the introduction of Network Banking, a banner appeared on the

      bottom of the screen when a counter was offline and any buttons to online-

      related services were disabled.

                                                                                     WITNO4110200
                                                                                  WITNO4110200




51.   In relation to network connectivity issues, the Counter Network Infrastructure

      Manager ("CNIM") would send frequent pings from the gateway counter to the

      datacentre_ See the document entitled `CNIM Low Level Design' (RS/LLD/004)

      and dated 8 May 2006 (FUJ00171956). CNIM would manage fail-over between

      the different network methods available to the branch and also record quality of

      service logs that were then sent from CNIM to the Tivoli SYSMAN ddabase so

      that the Tivoli team could see which branches had poor connection.


52.   A network management suite also pinged the branches from the datacentre

      frequently so that it was quickly apparent if a large number of branches were

      offline / disconnected from the network. As noted above, network issues did not

      generally fall within the remit of the SSC, but the SSC could retrieve quality of

      service logs if necessary for our diagnostic activities.


      HNG-X:

53.   HNG-X does not function offline. If the counter were to disconnect, it would

      probably do a forced logout which would abandon anything in the basket which

      was not recoverable and print a disconnection report.


54.   If a transaction is attempted offline in HNG-X, there would be a record in the

      application logs on the counter. There would also be Windows events for any

      network issues.


INTERPRETING THE ARQ SPREADSHEET

55.   The timeline in the ARQ Spreadsheet may appear confusing and out of order

      because, as user LCA001 transfers between counter positions (IDs) 1 and 2,

      they also suspend a Session before settling it. If the Riposte "Num" attribute

      was provided in the ARQ Spreadsheet, that would provide further detail in
